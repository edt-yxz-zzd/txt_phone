The prime number theorem and the nth prime

This is a much clearer restatement of an earlier question.

In section 1.8 of Hardy & Wright, An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers, it is proved that the function inverse to x/logx is asymptotic to xlogx. “From this remark we infer,” they say, that:

(*) The prime number theorem, π(x)∼x/logx , is equivalent to the theorem pn∼nlogn, where pn denotes the nth prime.

That the theorems are equivalent is easy to prove by a different method, as in Apostol's Introduction to Analytic Number Theory, Theorem 4.5. But how does the equivalence follow from H & W’s “remark”? As they say in section 1.5, since π(pn)=n, “π(x), as function of x, and pn, as function of n, are inverse functions”; but the inverses of asymptotic functions are not usually themselves asymptotic to one another. Would someone please explain how H & W mean for us to deduce (*)?

You definitely need something more about the nature of the functions ylogy and xlogx to prove it. –

@ThomasAndrews I think my new answer to the OP's other question should be applicable here. –

@ErickWong Yes, it is. There remains a mystery: at the outset of their book, after spelling out simpler arguments, why did H & W leave this one to the poor beginner? Did they have something else in mind? –

Note that, π(pn)=n, and clearly n≤pn , so that ln(n)≤ln(pn)

While I can't speak directly for Hardy and Wright, I think the following is a plausible explanation, based on a copy of the fourth edition of H&W. Just prior to claiming the equivalence of π(x)∼x/logx and pn∼nlogn, they spell out the argument that the inverse function of x/logx is asymptotic to xlogx. For completeness, here is the brief argument, very mildly paraphrased:

If y=x/logx then logy=logx−loglogx. Since loglogx=o(logx) we have logy∼logx and thus x=ylogx∼ylogy.

The point here is that this argument illustrates a "moral": the key observation is that once we establish that x and y are not too far apart (that is logx∼logy) then we can justify shifting between them and that this allows us to (asymptotically) invert functions which do not have nice inverses. Imagine now π(x) in the place of y, not in an exact copy of the above proof, but a modified version with this moral intact:

If y∼x/logx then logy=logx−loglogx+o(1). Since loglogx=o(logx) and o(1)=o(logx) we have logy∼logx and thus x∼ylogx∼ylogy.

This establishes Theorem 8 in a way that strongly echoes the preceding discussion (and without making any general claim of asymptotics of inverse functions). Likewise, the same argument goes through for ≍ instead of ∼, with O(1) replacing o(1).

I do agree there is sloppiness in saying that this inference follows "from the remark" and not in a manner akin to the remark. It's also interesting that they take the trouble to write out a proof of Theorem 9 (pn≍nlogn) from Theorem 7, but refer to Theorem 8 (pn∼nlogn) as a trivial consequence of Theorem 6 (the antecedent theorems in both cases being the corresponding estimate on π(x)). I'm inclined to chalk this up to human fallibility :).

Prime Counting Function
PrimeCountingFunction
The prime counting function is the function pi(x) giving the number of primes less than or equal to a given number x (Shanks 1993, p. 15). For example, there are no primes <=1, so pi(1)=0. There is a single prime (2) <=2, so pi(2)=1. There are two primes (2 and 3) <=3, so pi(3)=2. And so on.

The notation pi(n) for the prime counting function is slightly unfortunate because it has nothing whatsoever to do with the constant pi=3.1415.... This notation was introduced by number theorist Edmund Landau in 1909 and has now become standard. In the words of Derbyshire (2004, p. 38), "I am sorry about this; it is not my fault. You'll just have to put up with it."

Letting p_n denote the nth prime,p_n is a right inverse of pi(n) since

 pi(p_n)=n 	
(1)
for all positive integers. Also,

 p_(pi(n))=n 	
(2)
iff n is a prime number.

The first few values of pi(n) for n=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, ... (OEIS A000720). The Wolfram Language command giving the prime counting function for a number x is PrimePi[x], which works up to a maximum value of x approx 8×10^(13).

The notation pi_(a,b)(x) is used to denote the modular prime counting function, i.e., the number of primes of the form ak+b less than or equal to x (Shanks 1993, pp. 21-22).

The following table gives the values of pi(n) for powers of 10 (OEIS A006880), extending other printed tabulations (e.g., Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 4; Shanks 1993, pp. 242-243; Ribenboim 1996, p. 237; Derbyshire 2004, p. 35). Note that pi(10^9) was incorrectly computed as 50847478 by Meissel (1885), which is off by 56 (Havil 2003, p. 171), a result quoted by Hardy and Wright (1979) and Hardy (1999) and sometimes (erroneously) known as Bertelsen's number. The value for pi(10^(20)) comes from Deleglise and Rivat (1996), and pi(10^(21)) was reported by X. Gourdon on Oct. 27, 2000. Oliveira e Silva and X. Gourdon independently computed values for pi(10^(22)) and pi(10^(23)), but an error was found in the computations of Gourdon. The value given for pi(10^(23)) was computed by Tomás Oliveira e Silva, who verified this result using set sets of hardware and program parameters (pers. comm., Apr. 7, 2008). (Values of pi(x) computed independently by Oliveira e Silva and X. Gourdon already agree for all powers of 10 up to 10^(22).) pi(10^(25)) was computed by Büthe (2014), pi(10^(26)) by Staple in 2014 (Staple 2015), and pi(10^(27)) by D. Baugh and K. Walisch (2015) using the primecount fast prime counting function implementation (Walisch).

One of the most fundamental and important results in number theory is the asymptotic form of pi(n) as n becomes large. This is given by the prime number theorem, which states that

 pi(n)∼Li(n), 	
(3)
where Li(x) is the logarithmic integral and ∼ is asymptotic notation. This relation was first postulated by Gauss in 1792 (when he was 15 years old), although not revealed until an 1849 letter to Johann Encke and not published until 1863 (Gauss 1863; Havil 2003, pp. 176-177).

PrimeCountingFunctions
The following table compares the prime counting function pi(x), Riemann prime counting function R(x), and logarithmic integral Li(x) for powers of ten, i.e., x=10^n. The corresponding differences are plotted above for small x. Note that the values given by Hardy (1999, p. 26) for x=10^9 are incorrect. In the following table, [x] denotes the nearest integer function. A similar table comparing pi(10^n) and Li(10^n) is given by Borwein and Bailey (2003, p. 65).

The prime counting function can be expressed by Legendre's formula, Lehmer's formula, Mapes' method, or Meissel's formula. A brief history of attempts to calculate pi(n) is given by Berndt (1994). The following table is taken from Riesel (1994), where O(x) is asymptotic notation.

method	time complexity	storage complexity
Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko	O(x^(2/3+epsilon))	O(x^(1/3+epsilon))
Lagarias-Odlyzko 1	O(x^(3/5+epsilon))	O(x^epsilon)
Lagarias-Odlyzko 2	O(x^(1/2+epsilon))	O(x^(1/4+epsilon))
Legendre's formula	O(x)	O(x^(1/2))
Lehmer	O(x/(lnx)^4)	O(x^(1/3)/lnx)
Mapes' method	O(x^(0.7))	O(x^(0.7))
Meissel	O(x/(lnx)^3)	O(x^(1/2)/lnx)
PrimePiHarmonic
An approximate formula due to Locker-Ernst (Locker-Ernst 1959; Panaitopol 1999; Havil 2003, pp. 179-180), illustrated above, is given by

 pi(n) approx n/(h_n), 	
(4)
where h_n is related to the harmonic number H_n by h_n=H_n-3/2. This formula is within  approx 2 of the actual value for 50<=n<=1000. The values for which pi(n)-n/h_n>0 are 1, 109, 113, 114, 199, 200, 201, ... (OEIS A051046). Panaitopol (1999) shows that this quantity is positive for all n>=1429.

An upper bound for pi(n) is given by

 pi(n)<(1.25506n)/(lnn) 	
(5)
for n>1, and a lower bound by

 n/(lnn)<pi(n) 	
(6)
for n>=17 (Rosser and Schoenfeld 1962).

Hardy and Wright (1979, p. 414) give the formula

 pi(n)=-1+sum_(j=3)^n[(j-2)!-j|_((j-2)!)/j_|] 	
(7)
for n>3, where |_x_| is the floor function.

A modified version of the prime counting function is given by

 pi_0(p)={pi(p)   for p composite; pi(p)-1/2   for p prime 	
(8)
 pi_0(p)=sum_(n=1)^infty(mu(x)f(x^(1/n)))/n, 	
(9)
where mu(n) is the Möbius function and f(x) is the Riemann prime counting function.

Ramanujan also showed that

 (dpi(x))/(dx)∼1/(xlnx)sum_(n=1)^infty(mu(n))/nx^(1/n), 	
(10)
where mu(n) is the Möbius function (Berndt 1994, p. 117; Havil 2003, p. 199).

The smallest x such that x>=npi(x) for n=2, 3, ... are 2, 27, 96, 330, 1008, ... (OEIS A038625), and the corresponding pi(x) are 1, 9, 24, 66, 168, 437, ... (OEIS A038626). The number of solutions of x=npi(x) for n=2, 3, ... are 4, 3, 3, 6, 7, 6, ... (OEIS A038627).

Ramanujan showed that for sufficiently large x,

 pi^2(x)<(ex)/(lnx)pi(x/e). 	
(11)
This holds for x=6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, ... (OEIS A091886). The largest known prime for which the inequality fails is 38358837677 (Berndt 1994, pp. 112-113). The related inequality

 [li(x)]^2<(ex)/(lnx)li(x/e) 	
(12)
where

 li(x)=int_0^x(dt)/(lnt), 	
(13)
is true for x>=2418 and no smaller number (Berndt 1994, p. 114).

Partial sums of A010051 (characteristic function of primes). - Jeremy Gardiner, Aug 13 2002
pi(n) and prime(n) are inverse functions: a(A000040(n)) = n and A000040(n) is the least number m such that A000040(a(m)) = A000040(n). A000040(a(n)) = n if (and only if) n is prime. - Jonathan Sondow, Dec 27 2004
See the additional references and links mentioned in A143227. - Jonathan Sondow, Aug 03 2008
A lower bound that gets better with larger N is that there are at least T prime numbers less than N, where the recursive function T is: T = N - N*Sum_{i=0..T(sqrt(N))} A005867(i)/A002110(i). - Ben Paul Thurston, Aug 23 2010

Prime Number Theorem
PrimePi
The prime number theorem gives an asymptotic form for the prime counting function pi(n), which counts the number of primes less than some integer n. Legendre (1808) suggested that for large n,

 pi(n)∼n/(lnn+B), 	
(1)
with B=-1.08366 (where B is sometimes called Legendre's constant), a formula which is correct in the leading term only,

 n/(lnn+B)sinn/(lnn)-Bn/((lnn)^2)+B^2n/((lnn)^3)+... 	
(2)
(Nagell 1951, p. 54; Wagon 1991, pp. 28-29; Havil 2003, p. 177).

In 1792, when only 15 years old, Gauss proposed that

 pi(n)∼n/(lnn). 	
(3)
Gauss later refined his estimate to

 pi(n)∼Li(n), 	
(4)
where

 Li(n)=int_2^n(dx)/(lnx) 	
(5)
is the logarithmic integral. Gauss did not publish this result, which he first mentioned in an 1849 letter to Encke. It was subsequently posthumously published in 1863 (Gauss 1863; Havil 2003, pp. 174-176).

Note that Li(n) has the asymptotic series about infty of

Li(n)	∼	sum_(k=0)^(infty)(k!n)/((lnn)^(k+1))	
(6)
	∼	n/(lnn)+n/((lnn)^2)+(2n)/((lnn)^3)+...,	
(7)
and taking the first three terms has been shown to be a better estimate than n/lnn alone (Derbyshire 2004, pp. 116-117).

The statement (4) is often known as "the" prime number theorem and was proved independently by Hadamard (1896) and de la Vallée Poussin (1896). A plot of pi(n) (lower curve) and Li(n) is shown above for n<=1000.

For small n, it had been checked and always found that pi(n)<Li(n). As a result, many prominent mathematicians, including no less than both Gauss and Riemann, conjectured that the inequality was strict. To everyone's surprise, this conjecture was refuted when Littlewood (1914) proved that the inequality reverses infinitely often for sufficiently large n (Ball and Coxeter 1987; Havil 2003, p. 199). Skewes then showed that the first crossing of pi(n)-Li(n)=0 occurs before 10^(10^(10^(34))), a number now known as the Skewes number (Havil 2003, p. 199). The upper bound for the crossing has subsequently been reduced to 10^(371). Lehman (1966) proved that at least 10^(500) reversals occur for numbers with 1166 or 1167 decimal digits.

Chebyshev put limits on the ratio

 7/8<(pi(n))/(n/(lnn))<9/8 	
(8)
(Landau 1927; Nagell 1951, p. 55; Landau 1974; Hardy and Wright 1979, Ch. 22; Ingham 1990; Rubinstein and Sarnak 1994; Hardy 1999, p. 27; Derbyshire 2004, pp. 124 and 154). For large n, he showed that

 0.89Li(n)<pi(n)<1.11Li(n), 	
(9)
where Li(x) is the logarithmic integral (Edwards 2001, p. 4), and

 0.922<(pi(n))/(n/(lnn))<1.105 	
(10)
(Havil 2003, p. 186). He also showed that if the limit

 lim_(n->infty)(pi(n))/(n/(lnn)) 	
(11)
exists, then it is 1 (Havil 2003, p. 186). Derbyshire's (2004, p. 124) statement that in 1850, Chebyshev also showed that pi(n) cannot differ from n/lnn by more than approximately 10% is therefore correct only for sufficiently large n.

Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin independently proved the prime number theorem in 1896 by showing that the Riemann zeta function zeta(z) has no zeros of the form 1+it, in the sense that no deeper properties of zeta(s) are required for the proof (Smith 1994, p. 128; Hardy 1999, pp. 58-60). Wiener (1951) allowed this somewhat vague statement to be interpreted literally (Hardy 1999, pp. 34 and 46), and this proof was simplified by Landau (1932) and Bochner (1933).

An elementary proof was found by Erdős (1949) and Selberg (1950) (Ball and Coxeter 1987, p. 63; Havil 2003, p. 188), although an unfortunate priority dispute over the joint work marred the otherwise beautiful proof (Hoffman 1998, pp. 39-41; Derbyshire 2004, p. 125). Versions of elementary proofs of the prime number theorem appear in final section of Nagell (1951) and in Hardy and Wright (1979, pp. 359-367). As noted by Hardy and Wright (1979, p. 9), although this proof is 'elementary,' "this proof is not easy."

Hadamard's proof depends on the simple trigonometric inequality

 3+4costheta+cos(2theta)=2(1+costheta)^2>=0 	
(12)
(Hardy 1999, p. 58; Havil 2003, p. 187). de la Vallée Poussin (1899) showed that

 pi(x)=Li(x)+O(x/(lnx)e^(-asqrt(lnx))) 	
(13)
for some constant a (Knuth 1998, p. 381), where O(x) is asymptotic notation. In 1901, Koch showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, then

 pi(x)=Li(x)+O(sqrt(x)lnx) 	
(14)
(Havil 2003, p. 205), which can be written in the slightly weaker form

 pi(x)=Li(x)+O(x^(1/2+epsilon)) 	
(15)
(Derbyshire 2004, pp. 237 and 242-244).

The error term in (15) has subsequently been improved to

 pi(x)=Li(x)+O(xexp(-(A(lnx)^(3/5))/((lnlnx)^(1/5)))) 	
(16)
(Walfisz 1963; Riesel 1994, p. 56; Knuth 1998, p. 382; Derbyshire 2004, p. 244). Ingham (1930) proved the prime number theorem using the identity of Ramanujan

 sum_(n=1)^infty(sigma_a(n)sigma_b(n))/(n^s)=(zeta(s)zeta(s-a)zeta(s-b)zeta(s-a-b))/(zeta(2s-a-b)), 	
(17)
where sigma_a(n) is the divisor function (Hardy 1999, pp. 59-60).

Riemann estimated the prime counting function with

 pi(n)∼Li(n)-1/2Li(n^(1/2)), 	
(18)
which is a better approximation than Li(n) for n<10^7. Riemann (1859) also suggested the Riemann function

 R(x)=sum_(n=1)^infty(mu(n))/nLi(x^(1/n)), 	
(19)
where mu is the Möbius function (Wagon 1991, p. 29). An even better approximation for small n (by a factor of 10 for n<10^9) is the Gram series.

The prime number theorem is equivalent to either

 lim_(x->infty)(theta(x))/x=1 	
(20)
or

 lim_(x->infty)(psi(x))/x=1, 	
(21)
where theta(x) and psi(x) are the Chebyshev functions. Chebyshev showed that the only possible limit of these expressions was 1, but was not able to prove existence of the limit (Hardy 1999, p. 28).

The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that

 |Li(x)-pi(x)|<=csqrt(x)lnx 	
(22)
for some value of c (Ingham 1990, p. 83; Landau 1974, pp. 378-388; Ball and Coxeter 1987; Hardy 1999, p. 26), as shown by Koch in 1901 (Havil 2003, p. 205). Some limits obtained without assuming the Riemann hypothesis are

pi(x)	=	Li(x)+O[xe^(-(lnx)^(1/2)/15)]	
(23)
pi(x)	=	Li(x)+O[xe^(-0.009(lnx)^(3/5)/(lnlnx)^(1/5))].	
(24)
