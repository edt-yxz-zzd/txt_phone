Disjoint Union
In mathematics, a disjoint union (or discriminated union) of a family of sets (Aᵢ:i∈I) is a set A, often denoted by ⨆ᵢ∈IAᵢ, with an injection of each Aᵢ into A, such that the images of these injections form a partition of A (that is, each element of A belongs to exactly one of these images). The disjoint union of a family of pairwise disjoint sets is their union. In terms of category theory, the disjoint union is the coproduct of the category of sets, and thus defined up to a bijection
