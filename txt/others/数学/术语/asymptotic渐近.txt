Asymptotic
Informally, the term asymptotic means approaching a value or curve arbitrarily closely (i.e., as some sort of limit is taken). A line or curve A that is asymptotic to given curve C is called the asymptote of C.

More formally, let x be a continuous variable tending to some limit. Then a real function f(x) and positive function phi(x) are said to be asymptotically equivalent, written f∼phi, if

 f/phi->1 	
(1)
as the limit is taken.

Equivalently, consider the little-o asymptotic notation o(x) that is one of the Landau symbols. Then f=o(phi) means that

 f/phi->0 	
(2)
as a limit is taken. The statement f∼phi is then equivalent to

 f=phi+o(phi) 	
(3)
or

 f=phi(1+o(1)) 	
(4)
(Hardy and Wright 1979, pp. 7-8).

These definitions can also be applied to the discrete case of n an integer variable that tends to infinity, f(n) a real function of n, and phi(n) a positive function of n.

Asymptotic Notation
Let n be an integer variable which tends to infinity and let x be a continuous variable tending to some limit. Also, let phi(n) or phi(x) be a positive function and f(n) or f(x) any function. Then Hardy and Wright (1979) define

1. f=O(phi) to mean that |f|<Aphi for some constant A and all values of n and x,

2. f=o(phi) to mean that f/phi->0,

3. f∼phi to mean that f/phi->1,

4. f≺phi to mean the same as f=o(phi),

5. f≻phi to mean f/phi->infty, and

6. f=phi to mean A_1phi<f<A_2phi for some positive constants A_1 and A_2.

f=o(phi) implies and is stronger than f=O(phi).

The term Landau symbols is sometimes used to refer the big-O notation O(x) and little-O notation o(x). In general, O(x) and o(x) are read as "is of order x."

If f=phi, then f and phi are said to be of the same order of magnitude (Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 7).

If f∼g, or equivalently f=phi+o(phi) or f=phi(1+o(1)), then f and phi are said to be asymptotically equivalent (Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 8).
