Groups of small order
Compiled by John Pedersen, Dept of Mathematics, University of South Florida, jfp@math.usf.edu
Order 1 and all prime orders (1 group: 1 abelian, 0 nonabelian)
All groups of prime order p are isomorphic to C_p, the cyclic group of order p.
A concrete realization of this group is Z_p, the integers under addition modulo p.
Order 4 (2 groups: 2 abelian, 0 nonabelian)
C_4, the cyclic group of order 4
V = C_2 x C_2 (the Klein four group) = symmetries of a rectangle. A presentation for the group is
            <a, b; a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = 1> 
The Cayley table of the group is (putting c = ab):
              | 1  a  b  c
            --+-----------
            1 | 1  a  b  c
            a | a  1  c  b
            b | b  c  1  a
            c | c  b  a  1 
A matrix representation is the four 2x2 matrices
            [1 0]   [1  0]   [-1 0]   [-1  0]
            [0 1],  [0 -1],  [ 0 1],  [ 0 -1] 
A permutation representation is the following four elements of S_4:
           (1),  (1 2)(3 4),  (1 3)(2 4) and (1 4)(2 3).  
Its lattice of subgroups is (in the notation of the Cayley table)
                      V
                   /  |  \
                 <a> <b> <c>
                   \  |  /
                     {1} 
Order 6 (2 groups: 1 abelian, 1 nonabelian)
C_6
S_3, the symmetric group of degree 3 = all permutations on three objects, under composition. In cycle notation for permutations, its elements are (1), (1 2), (1 3), (2, 3), (1 2 3) and (1 3 2).
There are four proper subgroups of S_3; they are all cyclic. There are the three of order 2 generated by (1 2), (1 3) and (2 3), and the one of order 3 generated by (1 2 3). Only the one of order 3 is normal in S_3.
A presentation for S_3 is (where s corresponds to (1 2) and t to (2 3)):
            <s,t; s^2 = t^2 = 1, sts = tst> 
Another presentation (with s <-> (1 2 3), t <-> (1 2)) is
            <s,t; s^3 = t^2 = 1, ts = s^2 t> 
In terms of this second presentation, with 2 = s^2, u = ts and v = ts^2, the Cayley table is
              | 1  s  2  t  u  v
            --+-----------------------
            1 | 1  s  2  t  u  v
            s | s  2  1  v  t  u
            2 | 2  1  s  u  v  t
            t | t  u  v  1  s  2
            u | u  v  t  2  1  s
            v | v  t  u  s  2  1 
This shows S_3 is isomorphic to D_3, the dihedral group of degree 3, that is, the symmetries of an equilateral triangle (this never happens for n > 3). The lattice of subgroups of S_3 is
                          S_3
                    /  /   |   \
                  <t> <u> <v>  <s>
                    \  \   |   /
                          {1} 
The first three proper subgroups have order two, while <s> has order three and is the only normal one.
The center of S_3 is trivial (in fact Z(S_n) is trivial for all n.)
The automorphism group of S_3 is isomorphic to S_3.
Order 8 (5 groups: 3 abelian, 2 nonabelian)
C_8
C_4 x C_2
C_2 x C_2 x C_2
D_4, the dihedral group of degree 4, or octic group. It has a presentation
             <s, t; s^4 = t^2 = e; ts = s^3 t> 
In terms of these generators (s corresponds to rotation by pi/2 and t to a reflection about an axis through a vertex), the eight elements are 1,s,s^2,s^3,t,ts,ts^2 and ts^3. Using the notation 2 = s^2, 3 = s^3, t2 = ts^2 and t3 = ts^3, the Cayley table is
              | 1  s  2  3  t ts t2 t3
            --+------------------------
            1 | 1  s  2  3  t ts t2 t3
            s | s  2  3  1 t3  t ts t2
            2 | 2  3  1  s t2 t3  t ts
            3 | 3  1  s  2 ts t2 t3  t
            t | t ts t2 t3  1  s  2  3
           ts |ts t2 t3  t  3  1  s  2
           t2 |t2 t3  t ts  2  3  1  s
           t3 |t3  t ts t2  s  2  3  1 
Its subgroup lattice is
                             D_4
                  /           |         \
           {1,s^2,t,ts^2}    <s>   {1,s^2,st,ts}
         /     |         \    |   /       |      \
     <ts^2>   <t>           <s^2>       <st>     <ts>
          \      \            |          /        /
                             {1} 
Of these, the proper normal subgroups are the three of order four and <s^2> of order two.
The center of D_4 is {1,s^2}, which is also its derived group.
The automorphism group of D_4 is isomorphic to D_4.
Q, the quaternion group. It has a presentation
             <s, t; s^4 = 1, s^2 = t^2, sts = t> 
Q can be realized as consisting of the eight quaternions 1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k, where i is the imaginary square root of -1, and j and k also obey j^2 = k^2 = -1. These quaternions multiply according to clockwise movement around the figure
                               i
                            /      \
                           k  ----  j 
For example, ij = k and ji = -k (negative because anticlockwise).
A matrix representation is given by s and t in the above presentation corresponding to these two 2x2 matrices over the complex numbers:
           s = [i  0]     t = [0 i]
               [0 -i]         [i 0] 
The subgroup lattice of Q is
                                  Q
                            /     |     \
                          <s>    <st>   <t>
                            \     |     /
                                <s^2>
                                  |
                                 {1} 
All of these subgroups are normal in Q.
The center of Q is {1,s^2}, which is also its derived group.
The automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to S_4.

A_4, the alternating group of degree 4, consisting of the even permutations in S_4. The subgroup lattice of A_4 is
                               A_4
                            /     \        \        \         \
          <(12)(34),(13)(24)>    <(123)>  <(124)>  <(134)>  <(234)>
           /       |       \         |       /       /         /
    <(12)(34)> <(13)(24)> <(14)(23)> |      /       /         /
           \       \          \      /     /       /         /
                                 {1} 
The only proper normal subgroup is <(12)(34),(13)(24)>.
D_6, isomorphic to S_3 x C_2 = D_3 x C_2
T which has the presentation
       <s, t; s^6 = 1, s^3 = t^2, sts = t> 
T is the semidirect product of C_3 by C_4 by the map g : C_4 -> Aut(C_3) given by g(k) = a^k, where a is the automorphism a(x) = -x.
Another presentation for T is
        <x,y; x^4 = y^3 = 1, yxy = x> 
In terms of these generators, using AB for x^A y^B, the Cayley table for T is
           | 00  10  20  30  01  02  11  21  31  12  22  32

x^3y^2 = 32| 32  01  12  21  30  31  02  10  22  00  11  20 
A 2x2 matrix representation of this group over the complex numbers is given by
                   [0  i]              [w   0 ]
            x <--> [i  0]       y <--> [0  w^2]  
where i is a square root of -1 and w is nonreal cube root of 1, for example w = e^{2\pi i/3}.

Group of order 60

Let $G$ be a simple group of order $60$:

i) Find the number of Sylow $3$- and $5$-subgroups of $G$.

ii) Show that the alternating group $A_5$ has a subgroup of order $12$.

iii)Show that $G$ is isomorphic to $A_5$ if it has a subgroup of order $12$.

iv) $G$ is isomorphic to $A_5$.

I'm stuck at i), iii) and iv):

Let $s_p$ denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of $G$:

Because of $(60=2^2\cdot3\cdot5)$ I already know that $G$ must have Sylow $3$- and $5$-subgroups and that $s_3 \in \{1;4;10\}$ and $s_5 \in \{1;6\}$ because of $(s_3 \mid \text{ord}(G))$ and $(s_5 \mid \text{ord}(G))$ aswell as $(s_3 \equiv 1 \text{ mod }3)$ and $(s_5 \equiv 1 \text{ mod }5)$.

Is the following sufficient to exclude $1$ out of each set:

If $s_3=1$ or $s_5=1$ there is only one Sylow 3- or 5-subgroup. Because Sylow subgroups are conjugate to only one-another these Sylow 3- and 5-subgroups have to be normal in $G$. Contradiction: $G$ is simple. It follows that there are more than one Sylow 3- and 5-subgroups.

How would I go about narrowing down these even further?

The fact that $A_5$ has a subgroup of order $12$ I have already shown.

As for iii) and iv) I don't even know where to begin with. As other proofs of $G \cong A_5$ on Stackexchange use "Extended Sylow Theorem", "Burnside Transfer Theorem" and "Strong Cayley Theorem" (probably the same as the first one) I'm quite curious how to prove this without those theorems.

Thanks for checking in! ~Cedric

Yes that is sufficient to rule out $s_3,s_5 = 1$. Here's some advice on the points you asked about.

Advice on (i). I'll help you get started on $s_3$. First of all, you know $A_5$ has ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ subgroups of order 3, which must be the 3-sylow subgroups, so you probably shouldn't try to prove $s_3 = 4$. To prove $s_3 \neq 4$, use that $G$ acts by conjugation the set $X$ of $p$-sylow subgroups, which induces a homomorphism $G \to S_n$ where $n = |X|$. Prove there is no such injection in the case where $X$ is the set of 3-sylow subgroups if $s_3 = 4$.

Advice on (iii). Try to show that $G$ acts transitively on a set of order 5. Where can you find such a set? Hint: the assumption provides one for you!

Advice on (iv). This part is more tricky. At least its clear the problem is to show that $G$ has a subgroup of order 12 :) Hint: consider the intersection $P_2\cap P_2'$ of a pair of 2-sylow subgroups. What can you say about its normalizer? You should be able to reduce to the case it has size 12 or 20, and then rule out 20 for reasons similar to (i).

You can let me know with a comment if you think a while and are still stick.

Thanks for your Answer! It's very helpful :) iii) is now done! As for i): I understand that there can't be an injection from $G$ to $S_4$ as $\vert{G}\vert=60 > \vert{S_4}\vert=4!=24$, but how exactly does the conjugation induce this homomorphism and why is it sufficient to show it isn't injective (I guess the last part will follow from the first :P). iv) I'll try next! –

Integral representations of groups of small order

I have a problem in which it would be helpful to know about the integral representations of some groups of small order (probably of fairly low degree). From what I've gathered so far, cyclic groups of order p and order p^2 are understood, as are some special dihedral groups. But, often, Krull-Schmidt does not hold making a full classification difficult. Does anyone know of any papers where explicit examples are calculated? I can only find MCR Butler's example of the Klein group. I'd be happy to know about some cyclic cases that are not of order p or p^2.

Thanks!

Try Curtis and Reiner's book, around 1981-1 –

A couple of comments are combined here into a partial answer to the question:

As Geoff indicates, Methods of Representation Theory I by Curtis-Reiner has an extensive treatment of integral representations toward the end. In §34 there is a detailed discussion of examples, with the cautionary remark that a complete classification is essentially impossible for cyclic $p$-groups of higher order than $p^2$ due to infinite representation type.

Besides treating dihedral and metacyclic groups in some detail, they include at the end of §34 a careful summary of results (with references) about other groups studied in the literature. Keep in mind that this volume was published in 1981 and that Reiner specialized in integral representations but died around the time the second volume was published in 1987. I'm not sure what has been done in recent decades, but Curtis-Reiner cover thoroughly the methods in use at the time.
