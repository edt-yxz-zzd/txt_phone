Golay Code
The Golay code is a perfect linear error-correcting code. There are two essentially distinct versions of the Golay code: a binary version and a ternary version.

The binary version G_(23) is a (23,12,7) binary linear code consisting of 2^(12)=4096 codewords of length 23 and minimum distance 7. The ternary version is a (11,6,5) ternary linear code, consisting of 3^6=729 codewords of length 11 with minimum distance 5.

A parity check matrix for the binary Golay code is given by the matrix H=(M I_(11)), where I_(11) is the 11×11 identity matrix and M is the 11×12 matrix

 M=[1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1; 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1; 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0; 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0; 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0; 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1; 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0; 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0; 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1; 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1; 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]. 
By adding a parity check bit to each codeword in G_(23), the extended Golay code G_(24), which is a nearly perfect [24,12,8] binary linear code, is obtained. The automorphism group of G_(24) is the Mathieu group M_(24).

A second M_(24) generator is the adjacency matrix for the icosahedron, with J_(12)-I_(12) appended, where J_(12) is a unit matrix and I_(12) is an identity matrix.

A third M_(24) generator begins a list with the 24-bit 0 word (000...000) and repeatedly appends first 24-bit word that has eight or more differences from all words in the list. Conway and Sloane list many further methods.

Amazingly, Golay's original paper was barely a half-page long but has proven to have deep connections to group theory, graph theory, number theory, combinatorics, game theory, multidimensional geometry, and even particle physics.

Hamming Code
A binary Hamming code H_r of length n=2^r-1 (with r>=2) is a linear code with parity-check matrix H whose columns consist of all nonzero binary vectors of length r, each used once (MacWilliams and Sloane 1977). H_r is an (n=2^r-1,k=2^r-1-r,d=3) code. Hamming codes are perfect single error-correcting codes.

Linear Code
A linear code over a finite field with q elements F_q is a linear subspace C subset F_q^n. The vectors forming the subspace are called codewords. When codewords are chosen such that the distance between them is maximized, the code is called error-correcting since slightly garbled vectors can be recovered by choosing the nearest codeword.

Perfect Code
Let C be an error-correcting code consisting of N codewords,in which each codeword consists of n letters taken from an alphabet A of length q, and every two distinct codewords differ in at least d=2e+1 places. Then C is said to be perfect if for every possible word w_0 of length n with letters in A, there is a unique code word w in C in which at most e letters of w differ from the corresponding letters of w_0.

It is straightforward to show that C is perfect if

 sum_(i=0)^e(n; i)(q-1)^i=(q^n)/N. 
If C is a binary linear code, then q=2 and N=2^k, where k is the number of generators of C, in which case C is perfect if

 sum_(i=0)^e(n; i)=2^(n-k). 
Hamming codes and the Golay code are the only nontrivial examples of perfect codes.

Nearly Perfect Code
Let C be an error-correcting code consisting of N codewords in which each codeword consists of n letters taken from an alphabet A of length q, and every two distinct codewords differ in at least d=2e places. Then C is said to be nearly perfect if, for every possible word w_0 of length n with letters in A, there is a codeword w in C in which at most e letters of w differ from the corresponding letters of w_0. The codeword w is unique if it differs from w_0 in fewer than e places and there is at most one other codeword differing from w_0 in e places if w differs from w_0 in e places.

A nearly perfect code C^' can be derived from a perfect code C by adding a parity check digit to the end of each codeword in C, so if C is a [n,k,d]-perfect binary linear code, then C^' is a [n+1,k,d+1]-nearly perfect binary linear code. In this way, the nearly perfect extended Golay code can be obtained from the perfect Golay code and the nearly perfect extended Hamming codes from the perfect Hamming codes.

Error-Correcting Code
An error-correcting code is an algorithm for expressing a sequence of numbers such that any errors which are introduced can be detected and corrected (within certain limitations) based on the remaining numbers. The study of error-correcting codes and the associated mathematics is known as coding theory.

Error detection is much simpler than error correction, and one or more "check" digits are commonly embedded in credit card numbers in order to detect mistakes. Early space probes like Mariner used a type of error-correcting code called a block code, and more recent space probes use convolution codes. Error-correcting codes are also used in CD players, high speed modems, and cellular phones. Modems use error detection when they compute checksums, which are sums of the digits in a given transmission modulo some number. The ISBN used to identify books also incorporates a check digit.

A powerful check for 13 digit numbers consists of the following. Write the number as a string of digits a_1a_2a_3...a_(13). Take a_1+a_3+...+a_(13) and double. Now add the number of digits in odd positions which are >4 to this number. Now add a_2+a_4+...+a_(12). The check number is then the number required to bring the last digit to 0. This scheme detects all single digit errors and all transpositions of adjacent digits except 0 and 9.

Let A(n,d) denote the maximal number of n (0,1)-vectors having the property that any two of the set differ in at least d places. The corresponding vectors can correct [(d-1)/2] errors. A(n,d,w) is the number of A(n,d)s with precisely w 1s (Sloane and Plouffe 1995). Since it is not possible for n-vectors to differ in d>n places and since n-vectors which differ in all n places partition into disparate sets of two,

 A(n,d)=1 if n<d; 2 if n=d.
(1)
Values of A(n,d) can be found by labeling the 2^n (0,1)-n-vectors, finding all unordered pairs (a_i,a_j) of n-vectors which differ from each other in at least d places, forming a graph from these unordered pairs, and then finding the clique number of this graph. Unfortunately, finding the size of a clique for a given graph is an NP-complete problem.

Since A(n,3) = A(n+1,4), A(n,3) gives essentially the same sequence.
The next term a(17) is in the range 2816-3276.
Let T_n be the set of SDS-maps of sequential dynamical systems defined over the complete graph K_n in which all vertices have the same vertex function (defined using a set of two possible vertex states). Then a(n) is the maximum number of period-2 orbits that a function in T_n can have. - Colin Defant, Sep 15 2015
Since the n-halved cube graph is isomorphic to (or, if you prefer, defined as) the graph with binary sequences of length n-1 as nodes and edges between pairs of sequences that differ in at most two positions, the independence number of the n-halved cube graph is A(n-1,3) = a(n). - Pontus von Brömssen, Dec 12 2018
