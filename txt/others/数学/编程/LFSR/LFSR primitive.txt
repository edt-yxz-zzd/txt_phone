Information on Primitive and Irreducible Polynomials

For now, COS only generates polynomials over GF(2), GF(3), GF(4) and GF(5).

For GF(2), the coefficients are either 0 or 1 and the rules for multiplication and addition are 0 = 0+0 = 1+1 = 0*0 = 0*1 = 1*0 and 1 = 0+1 = 1+0 = 1*1.

A polynomial over GF(2) is irreducible if it cannot be factored into non-trivial polynomials. For example, x2+x+1 is irreducible, but x2+1 is not, since x2+1 = (x+1)(x+1).

The order of a polynomial f(x) for which f(0) is not 0 is the smallest integer e for which f(x) divides xe+1. A polynomial over GF(2) is primitive if it has order 2n-1. For example, x2+x+1 has order 3 = 22-1 since (x2+x+1)(x+1) = x3+1. Thus x2+x+1 is primitive.

The number of degree n irreducible polynomials over GF(q) is
Lq(n)   =   	
1
n
	  	
__
\
/   
d | n
	µ(n/d) q d ,
where µ(m) is the Möbius function: 0 if m is not the product of distinct primes, +1 if it is the product of an even number of distinct primes, and -1 otherwise. For example, L2(6) = (26 - 23 - 22 + 2)/6 = 54/6 = 9 counts irreducible polynomials of degree 6 over GF(2). The number Lq(n) also counts the number of aperiodic necklaces of length n over the alphabet 0,1,...,q-1.

The number, Lq(n), of irreducible polynomials over GF(2) for n=1,2,...,15 is 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 30, 56, 99, 186, 335, 630, 1161, 2182. This is sequence Anum=A001037"> A001037(M0116) in

The number of degree n primitive polynomials over GF(q) is Ø(qn -1)/n, where Ø(m) is Euler's totient function, the number of numbers less than m and relatively prime to m. For example, Ø(63) = |{2,4,5,8,...,62}| = 36 and thus the number of primitive polynomials of degree 6 over GF(2) is 36/6 = 6.

The number of primitive polynomials over GF(2) for n=1,2,...,15 is 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 6, 18, 16, 48, 60, 176, 144, 630, 756, 1800. This is sequence Anum=A011260"> A011260(M0107) in

Below we show the output of COS for n=6 and irreducible polynomials. Primitive polynomials are output in blue. The meanings of the different output options should be obvious.

Using our program we have computed some tables that may be of interest. The density of a polynomial is the number of non-zero terms. The index of a polynomial is the sum of the exponents of the non-zero terms.

    Florent Chabaud has a page on Galois fields that contains extensive lists of irreducible polynomials over GF(2) and GF(3), particularly trinomials and polynomials of low "subdegree". This site also includes Malcolm Greig's extensive list of one primitive polynomial over GF(pn) for many primes p and numbers n > 1.
    Here's a table of irreducible polynomials over GF(2), taken from Peterson's book on error-correcting codes.
    Phil Koopman has a page on Maximal Length LFSR Feedback Terms. These are equivalent to primitive polynomials over GF(2). He has exhaustive lists for n = 2,3,...,32 and provides the first 100 (in lexicographic order) for n = 2,3,...,39.
