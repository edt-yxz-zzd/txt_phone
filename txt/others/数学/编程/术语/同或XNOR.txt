XNOR gate
The XNOR gate (sometimes ENOR, EXNOR or NXOR and pronounced as Exclusive NOR) is a digital logic gate whose function is the logical complement of the Exclusive OR (XOR) gate. It is equivalent to the logical connective (↔) from mathematical logic, also known as the material biconditional. The two-input version implements logical equality, behaving according to the truth table to the right, and hence the gate is sometimes called an "equivalence gate".


XNOR gate has two or more inputs and only one output.

It produces output 1 for those input combination that have even number of 1's on the input side or all the input combination is 0.
