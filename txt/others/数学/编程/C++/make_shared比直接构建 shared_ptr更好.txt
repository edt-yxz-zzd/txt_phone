make_shared比直接构建 shared_ptr更好
  内存泄漏:
    Moreover, f(shared_ptr(new int(42)), g()) can lead to memory leak if g throws an exception. This problem doesn't exist if make_shared is used.
  分配整块内存，而非两个:
     make_shared/allocation both ensures only a single allocation.
       *make_shared uses the global operator new to allocate memory
       *allocate_shared uses an user-supplied allocator, allowing finer control.
