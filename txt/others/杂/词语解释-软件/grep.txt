grep===Global Regular Expression Print

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/how-to-use-grep
The grep command, which is an initialism for global regular expression print, started its life as a personal utility script on the computer of the co-creator of UNIX, Ken Thompson. (This tool received wide release only because Thompson's department head, Doug McIlroy, asked for a tool “to look for stuff” in files.)
