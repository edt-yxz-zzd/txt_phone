This Wikipedia page gives a classification of where each definition, that is base $2$, $e$ and $10$, are used:

$\log (x)$ refers to $\log_2 (x)$ in computer science and information theory.

$\log(x)$ refers to $\log_e(x)$ or the natural logrithm in mathematical analysis, physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and some engineering fields.

$\log(x)$ refers to $\log_{10}(x)$ in various engineering fields, logarithm tables, and handheld calculators.
