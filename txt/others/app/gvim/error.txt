退出时出错:
  :q
    出现 E138 E929

  :h error
    并没能找到相应的错误信息
  :messages
    错误信息历史 也没有 这俩信息

  :h E138
  :h E929
    都是指向 wviminfo
    :!rm -i ~/.viminf*.tmp
    :!rm -i ~/.viminf{{a..n},{p..z}}.tmp
      只保留了 ~/.viminfo.tmp

    [[
			*:wv* *:wviminfo* *E137* *E138* *E574* *E886* *E929*
:wv[iminfo][!] [file]	Write to viminfo file [file] (default: see above).
			The information in the file is first read in to make
			a merge between old and new info.  When [!] is used,
			the old information is not read first, only the
			internal info is written.  If 'viminfo' is empty, marks
			for up to 100 files will be written.
			When you get error "E929: Too many viminfo temp files"
			check that no old temp files were left behind (e.g.
			~/.viminf*) and that you can write in the directory of
			the .viminfo file.
