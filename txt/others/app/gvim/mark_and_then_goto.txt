7. Marks					*mark-motions* *E20* *E78*

Jumping to a mark can be done in two ways:
1. With ` (backtick):	  The cursor is positioned at the specified location
			  and the motion is |exclusive|.
2. With ' (single quote): The cursor is positioned on the first non-blank
			  character in the line of the specified location and
			  the motion is linewise.

						*m* *mark* *Mark*
m{a-zA-Z}		Set mark {a-zA-Z} at cursor position (does not move
			the cursor, this is not a motion command).
