Is there a default tags file included with Vim for the help system?
Yes, it should work out-of-the-box. But you can always recreate them (note that write privilege is required):
	:helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc
Alternatively, you can recreate all tags at once, including all installed plugins, with
	:helptags ALL
