:h range
	{number}	an absolute line number
	.		the current line			  *:.*
	$		the last line in the file		  *:$*
	%		equal to 1,$ (the entire file)		  *:%*
	't		position of mark t (lowercase)		  *:'*
	'T		position of mark T (uppercase); when the mark is in
			another file it cannot be used in a range
	/{pattern}[/]	the next line where {pattern} matches	  *:/*
	?{pattern}[?]	the previous line where {pattern} matches *:?*
	\/		the next line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\?		the previous line where the previously used search
			pattern matches
	\&		the next line where the previously used substitute
			pattern matches

Each may be followed (several times) by '+' or '-' and an optional number.
This number is added or subtracted from the preceding line number.  If the
number is omitted, 1 is used.

The "/" and "?" after {pattern} are required to separate the pattern from
anything that follows.

The "/" and "?" may be preceded with another address.  The search starts from
there.  The difference from using ';' is that the cursor isn't moved.
Examples: >
	/pat1//pat2/	Find line containing "pat2" after line containing
			"pat1", without moving the cursor.
	7;/pat2/	Find line containing "pat2", after line 7, leaving
			the cursor in line 7.
