    Err:9 https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian  InRelease

    E: The repository 'https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian  InRelease' is no longer signed.    
    N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.

That's mean the repo is not publicly accessible [2].

What should you do:

    Remove the old Repo

    sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb http://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /"   
    sudo rm -fv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
    sudo rm -fv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list.save
    sudo apt update

    Based on your sources list. simply remove .list files.

    Install sbt package from new Repo [3]

    sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg -yqq
    echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
    echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt_old.list
    curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo -H gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/scalasbt-release.gpg --import
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/scalasbt-release.gpg
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install sbt     

    or you can install sbt package from TGZ archives through sdk manager:

    wget https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/download/v1.5.5/sbt-1.5.5.tgz     
    sudo tar xzvf sbt-1.5.5.tgz -C /usr/share/     
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/sbt sbt
    sdk install sbt

Additionally
The ssl of https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823 may not work on 18.04 since it's using a gnupg. we can download the public key using web API. Run:

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823

Hope this Helps.

N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

How can I run an update without getting this error? Is it a matter of somehow removing this repository to get updates from?

The last thing I did was try and install the dotnet sdk on my system:

wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

But I haven't run an update in a while so maybe it could have been something else...

Update

I am unable to update my server now b/c of this error. Is there a way to just skip this repository somehow? Does this package get read by everyone or is it just mine instance b/c I was trying to install a package and now it has added this repo to my list of resources to check for updates?

I will first answer your specific questions, ...

    How can I run an update without getting this error? Is it a matter of somehow removing this repository to get updates from? Is there a way to just skip this repository somehow? (I am listing them all together since they have all the same answer). Yes, see comand sudo mv ... suggested below.
    Does this package get read by everyone or is it just mine instance b/c I was trying to install a package and now it has added this repo to my list of resources to check for updates? It gets read by everyone, since the changes were introduced in a system-wide location, /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.

... and then expand as follows.
You have to clarify what you want to do. For the various cases:

    If you simply want to update, remove the failing repos from your /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. You could apply several methods to remove ppas added to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, e.g. simply renaming files /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<myppa>.list to something like <myppa>.list.save.

     $ sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list.save

    This way, you would keep your files just in case. That should be enough to get you going.

    If you additionally want to update sbt, execute

     $ echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
     $ echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt_old.list
     $ curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add
     $ sudo apt update
     $ sudo apt install sbt

    Commands slightly modified from this official source (apt-get -> apt). Old repos https://dl.bintray.com/loadimpact/debian and https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian/sbt-1.5.5.deb are now forbidden. This is similar to what abu-ahmed al-khatiri quotes.

    If you want to update other packages that belong to failing repos, then please clarify that, so we can help with the specific cases.

I also note a couple of points about your Microsoft products.

    You installed packages-microsoft-prod.deb from 16.04. You should install the package for the correct version, 20.04.

    It is often safer to use sudo gdebi <pkg>.deb than sudo dpkg -i <pkg>.deb (as instructed in item 1 above). In this case, given that instructions come directly from MS, it is likely the same.

    You are hitting a repo for hirsute 21.04, Hit:6 https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/21.04/prod hirsute InRelease (likely in your microsoft-prod.list). You should remove that and add the repo for focal 20.04. Follow these instructions under Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal).

I suggest you post in the question the output of

$ uname -a
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
$ ls -alFh /etc/apt/sources.list.d

    @Blankman - *.save are not read by apt, so you would be ok with only removing /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list. You still have to clarify if you only mean to get rid of the errors, or if you need sbt from somehere in the galaxy. –

Bintray is shutdown and not hosting sbt repository anymore so You need to update sbt repo.

First remove source list files of old sbt repo.

sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt*

Also check /etc/apt/source.list file and make sure that you remove entries of old sbt repository.

Install new sbt repository source list and gpg key.

echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt_old.list
curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add
sudo apt-get update

    they fixed it but if you install it on play store it will have the problem because they will no longer update the app in play store but they are updating the app in F-Droid if you want to latest and fixed version download from F-Droid not from Play Store –

Solve Termux repository is under maintenance or down issue

There are mainly 2 options to solve this issue:
Solution 1:

If possible, use Termux from F-Droid because there are some problems with the one from Google Play.
Solution 2:

If you are unable to update or install any package in termux then you can follow the below method to solve this issue.

    First of all type the below command:

termux-change-repo

    Now You will see the main repo will be already selected and you just have to check all ( select all ) gaming as well as the science repo and then tap on the OK button.

    Now you have to switch from official repo to Alberto repo just select the Alberto Repo and tap on OK Button and the problem will be sloved.

you can also use

Or

Remove science and game repo packages to fix it This problem is caused by the shutdown of bintray repos

The package repository is currently offline due to exceeding the bandwidth quota on Bintray. We have asked for it to be re-renabled, and it should hopefully come online within a day.
