[[断点续传

 -c
 --continue
     Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
     you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
     Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

             wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

     If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget
     will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
     will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal
     to the length of the local file.

     Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want
     the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
     the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default
     behavior.  -c only affects resumption of downloads started prior to
     this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting
     around.

     Without -c, the previous example would just download the remote
     file to ls-lR.Z.1, leaving the truncated ls-lR.Z file alone.

     If you use -c on a non-empty file, and the server does not support
     continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from scratch
     and overwrite the existing file entirely.

     Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use -c on a file which is of equal
     size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
     file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the
     file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it
     was changed on the server since your last download
     attempt)---because "continuing" is not meaningful, no download
     occurs.

     On the other side of the coin, while using -c, any file that's
     bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
     download and only "(length(remote) - length(local))" bytes will be
     downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
     behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can
     use wget -c to download just the new portion that's been appended
     to a data collection or log file.

     However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
     changed, as opposed to just appended to, you'll end up with a
     garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
     really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
     especially careful of this when using -c in conjunction with -r,
     since every file will be considered as an "incomplete download"
     candidate.

     Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
     -c is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a "transfer
     interrupted" string into the local file.  In the future a
     "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.

     Note that -c only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers that
     support the "Range" header.
