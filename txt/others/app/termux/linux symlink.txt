linux symlink
	create a new symlink (will fail if symlink exists already):
		ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink
	create or update a symlink:
		ln -sf /path/to/file /path/to/symlink
Why are hard links not allowed for directories?
	softlink - weakref
	hardlink - ref
	----
	Hardlinks are not permitted because they would lead to cycles. Once you allow cycles to form, you must perform a mark-and-sweep garbage collection to detect when isolated cycles of directories (no longer reachable from the root) can be finally deleted - this is extremely expensive on disk.
