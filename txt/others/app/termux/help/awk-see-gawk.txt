   I/O Statements
       print                Print the current record.  The output record is
                            terminated with the value of ORS.

       print expr-list      Print expressions.  Each expression is separated
                            by the value of OFS.  The output record is
                            terminated with the value of ORS.

       print expr-list >file
                            Print expressions on file.  Each expression is
                            separated by the value of OFS.  The output record
                            is terminated with the value of ORS.

       printf fmt, expr-list
                            Format and print.

       printf fmt, expr-list >file
                            Format and print on file.

       system(cmd-line)     Execute the command cmd-line, and return the exit
                            status.  (This may not be available on non-POSIX
                            systems.)  See
                            https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I_002fO-Functions.html#I_002fO-Functions
                            for the full details on the exit status.

       Additional output redirections are allowed for print and printf.

       print ... >> file
              Append output to the file.

       print ... | command
              Write on a pipe.

       print ... |& command
              Send data to a coprocess or socket.  (See also the subsection
              Special File Names, below.)

   Built-in Variables

       RS         The input record separator, by default a newline.

       RT         The record terminator.  Gawk sets RT to the input text that
                  matched the character or regular expression specified by RS.

       RSTART     The index of the first character matched by match(); 0 if no
                  match.

       RLENGTH    The length of the string matched by match(); -1 if no match.

       FIELDWIDTHS
                  A whitespace-separated list of field widths.  When set, gawk
                  parses the input into fields of fixed width, instead of
                  using the value of the FS variable as the field separator.
                  Each field width may optionally be preceded by a colon-
                  separated value specifying the number of characters to skip
                  before the field starts.




       FILENAME   The name of the current input file.  If no files are
                  specified on the command line, the value of FILENAME is "-".
                  However, FILENAME is undefined inside the BEGIN rule (unless
                  set by getline).

       FNR        The input record number in the current input file.

       FPAT       A regular expression describing the contents of the fields
                  in a record.  When set, gawk parses the input into fields,
                  where the fields match the regular expression, instead of
                  using the value of FS as the field separator.

       FS         The input field separator, a space by default.  See
                  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Field-Separators.html
                  for the details.

       FUNCTAB    An array whose indices and corresponding values are the
                  names of all the user-defined or extension functions in the
                  program.  NOTE: You may not use the delete statement with
                  the FUNCTAB array.

       IGNORECASE Controls the case-sensitivity of all regular expression and
                  string operations.  See
                  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Case_002dsensitivity.html
                  for details.

       LINT       Provides dynamic control of the --lint option from within an
                  AWK program.

       NF         The number of fields in the current input record.

       NR         The total number of input records seen so far.

       OFMT       The output format for numbers, "%.6g", by default.

       OFS        The output field separator, a space by default.

       ORS        The output record separator, by default a newline.
