       \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)

       Your shell may have its own version of echo, which usually supersedes
       the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
       for details about the options it supports.

       Consider using the 'printf' command instead, as it avoids problems when
       outputting option-like strings.
