man lzma
  『lzma』 is equivalent to 『xz --format=lzma』.

man xz
  ==>> file suffix: .xz  .lzma  .lz  ; .txz  .tlz # .txz==.tar.xz  .tlz==.tar.lz
  ==>> format:auto,xz,lzma/alone,lzip,raw
  The native file format is the .xz format
    , but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA Utils and raw compressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.
    In addition, decompression of the .lz format used by lzip is supported.

  -c, --stdout, --to-stdout
  Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are written to a new file whose name is derived from the source file name:
  * When compressing, the suffix of the target file format (.xz or .lzma) is appended to the source filename to get the target filename.
  * When decompressing, the .xz, .lzma, or .lz suffix is removed from the filename to get the target filename.
    xz also recognizes the suffixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces them with the .tar suffix.


  Basic file format and compression options
    -F format, --format=format
      Specify the file format to compress or decompress:
        # format:auto,xz,lzma/alone,lzip,raw
        * auto
          This is the default.
          When compressing, auto is equivalent to xz.
          When decompressing, the format of the input file is automatically detected.
            Note that raw streams (created with --format=raw) cannot be auto-detected.

        * xz
          Compress to the .xz file format, or accept only .xz files when decompressing.

        * lzma, alone
          Compress to the legacy .lzma file format, or accept only .lzma files when decompressing.
          The alternative name alone is provided for backwards compatibility with LZMA Utils.

        * lzip
          Accept only .lz files when decompressing.  Compression is not supported.

        * raw
          Compress or uncompress a raw stream (no headers).
          This is meant for advanced users only.
          To decode raw streams, you need use --format=raw and explicitly specify the filter chain, which normally would have been stored in the container headers.


LZMA UTILS COMPATIBILITY
  The command line syntax of xz is practically a superset of lzma, unlzma, and lzcat as found from LZMA Utils 4.32.x.
  In most cases, it is possible to replace LZMA Utils with XZ Utils without breaking existing scripts.
  There are some incompatibilities though, which may sometimes cause problems.
