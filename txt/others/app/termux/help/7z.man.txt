NAME
       7z - A file archiver with highest compression ratio

SYNOPSIS
       7z [adeltux] [-] [SWITCH] <ARCHIVE_NAME> <ARGUMENTS>...

DESCRIPTION
       7-Zip is a file archiver with the highest compression ratio. The
       program supports 7z (that implements LZMA compression algorithm), ZIP,
       CAB, ARJ, GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, CPIO, RPM and DEB formats. Compression
       ratio in the new 7z format is 30-50% better than ratio in ZIP format.

       7z uses plugins to handle archives.

       -l     don't store symlinks; store the files/directories they point to
              (CAUTION : the scanning stage can never end because of recursive
              symlinks like 'ln -s .. ldir')

       -m{Parameters}
              Set Compression Method (see
              /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share/doc/p7zip/DOC/MANUAL/cmdline/switches/method.htm
              for a list of methods)

       -mhe=on|off

       -p{Password}
              Set Password

       -r[-|0]
              Recurse subdirectories (CAUTION: this flag does not do what you
              think, avoid using it)

       -sfx[{name}]
              Create SFX archive

       -si    Read data from StdIn (eg: tar cf - directory | 7z a -si
              directory.tar.7z)

       -so    Write data to StdOut (eg: % echo foo | 7z a dummy -tgzip -si -so
              > /dev/null)

       -slt   Sets technical mode for l (list) command

       -t{Type}
              Type of archive (7z, zip, gzip, bzip2, lzip or tar. 7z format is
              default)

       -v{Size}[b|k|m|g]
              Create volumes

       -u[-][p#][q#][r#][x#][y#][z#][!newArchiveName]
              Update options

       -w[path]
              Set Working directory

       -x[r[-|0]]]{@listfile|!wildcard}
              Exclude filenames

       -y     Assume Yes on all queries

DIAGNOSTICS
       7-Zip returns the following exit codes:

              0      Normal (no errors or warnings detected)

              1      Warning (Non fatal error(s)). For example, some files
                     cannot be read during compressing. So they were not
                     compressed

              2      Fatal error

              7      Bad command line parameters

              8      Not enough memory for operation

              255    User stopped the process with control-C (or similar)

Backup and limitations
       DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix because :
        - 7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.


       On Linux/Unix, in order to backup directories you must use tar :
        - to backup a directory  : tar cf - directory | 7za a -si
       directory.tar.7z
        - to restore your backup : 7za x -so directory.tar.7z | tar xf -

       If you want to send files and directories (not the owner of file) to
       others Unix/MacOS/Windows users, you can use the 7-zip format.

         example : 7za a directory.7z  directory


       Do not use "-r" because this flag does not do what you think.

       Do not use directory/* because of ".*" files (example : "directory/*"
       does not match "directory/.profile")

EXAMPLE 1
       7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1
              adds all files from directory "dir1" to archive archive.7z using
              "ultra settings"

       -t7z   7z archive

       -m0=lzma
              lzma method

       -mx=9  level of compression = 9 (Ultra)

       -mfb=64
              number of fast bytes for LZMA = 64

       -md=32m
              dictionary size = 32 megabytes

       -ms=on solid archive = on

EXAMPLE 2
       7z a -sfx archive.exe dir1
              add all files from directory "dir1" to SFX archive archive.exe
              (Remark : SFX archive MUST end with ".exe")

EXAMPLE 3
       7z a -mhe=on -pmy_password archive.7z a_directory
              add all files from directory "a_directory" to the archive
              "archive.7z" (with data and header archive encryption on)
