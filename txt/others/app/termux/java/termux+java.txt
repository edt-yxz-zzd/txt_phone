How to install java in termux.
TECH-X July 04, 2020


In this blog post I am gonna write some simple steps for the installation of java in termux without rooting you android device. There some few steps you have to do only. If you are java programmer looking for java, run java programs in android. It work totally like work on windows command prompt cli. But few features are not available or few packages are not work like awt (abstract window toolkit) & applets programs. But maximum  work done by this open-jdk-jre headless.

Installation process :    

First update and upgrade the termux type the following commands.

$ apt update
$ apt upgrade


Now, install the package wget execute command

$ apt install wget


Copy the this link and paste it on Termux by using command.

$wget https://archive.org/download/openjdk-9-jre-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_x86_64/openjdk-9-jdk-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb

This command will download openjdk-9-jdk-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb file to your termux

Next you have to download openjdk-9-jre-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb file to your.
This file is approx 220mb so, it will take some time to download. Copy the command from here.

$ wget https://archive.org/download/openjdk-9-jre-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_x86_64/openjdk-9-jre-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb

Here, You will get two files 
openjdk-9-jdk-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb
openjdk-9-jre-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb
 You have to install both file one by one to install them execute command

$ apt-get install -y ./openjdk-9-jdk-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb

Again for second deb file

$ apt-get install -y ./openjdk-9-jre-headless_9.2017.8.20-1_arm.deb


Now check whether Java is installed
Type  java on termux 

Then type javac 

Now you can compile and run java program in termux. 

Another alternative method to run java programs on termux 

Alternative method for installing and using java in termux.
In this method you need to install two packages of termux. 
ecj - (Eclipse compiler for java) this compile your java program and create .class file.
dx -  it take class file reformulate .dex file for run the .class file.

Let's start:
To install ecj and dx run the command 

$ apt install ecj
$ apt install dx


To compile and run the java program using this method you have to execute following commands 

$ ecj file_name.java

.class file is created now next command 
$ dx -dex-output=file_name.dex class_name

This create file_name.dex file
 Now run the program execute command

$ dalvikvm -cp  file_name.dex  class_name
