inside [[  ]]
   When used with [[, the < and > operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.  The test command sorts using ASCII ordering.
   -o optname
          True if the shell option optname is enabled.  See the list of options under the description of the -o option to the set builtin below.
   -v varname
          True if the shell variable varname is set (has been assigned a value).
   -R varname
          True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference.
   -z string
          True if the length of string is zero.
   string
   -n string
          True if the length of string is non-zero.

   string1 == string2
   string1 = string2
          True if the strings are equal.  = should be used with the test command for POSIX conformance.  When used with the [[ command, this performs pattern matching as described above (Compound Commands).

   string1 != string2
          True if the strings are not equal.

   string1 < string2
          True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.

   string1 > string2
          True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.

   arg1 OP arg2
          OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.
          These arithmetic binary operators return true if arg1 is equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to arg2, respectively.
          Arg1 and arg2 may be positive or negative integers.  When used with the [[ command, Arg1 and Arg2 are evaluated as arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above).
