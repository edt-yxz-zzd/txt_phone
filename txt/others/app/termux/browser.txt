The 7 best open-source terminal web browsers
By Enock December 6, 2021
open source terminal web browsers
Browsing websites from the command line has a niche following from seasoned Linux users. In the early days, users could access the websites from a terminal using text-only browsers like Lynx. At the time, most people used low-powered PCs with slow internet connections. Fast forward, Linux users are spoilt for choices with many modern GUI web browsers like Firefox, Chromium, Brave, or lightweight browsers like Midori, Otter. However, browsing from the terminal is still much practiced.

The article describes some of the best text-based web browsers and how to install them in your Linux distribution.

A text-based web browser displays the text content of a website. The majority of its niche community are seasoned Linux command line users who want to get everything done from the terminal. Text-based browsers provide faster loading and minimum bandwidth usage, which is great for low bandwidth connections. Another use case of command-line browsers is for system administrators who only interact with a terminal console.


Text-based web browsers for Linux command line usage
Without much further ado, let’s get into our list of the best open-source terminal web browsers.





1. w3m
w3m
w3m github.com

w3m is a simple open-source text-based web browser for the terminal. An active version of the project is maintained by Tatsuya Kinoshita as the chief developer. w3m supports SSL connections, colors, and in-line images. The browser will render tables and even accept cookies. You can navigate web pages using a mouse. Moreover, it lets you view images on a page using an external program.

Its web page rendering is clean and colorful. However, depending on what resource you are trying to access, the display text might look different on your system. A caveat of the browser is that it doesn’t support JavaScript.

After you load a page, you can use keyboard arrow keys to navigate and press enter to take action. To quit, press SHIFT+Q, SHIFT+B to go back to the previous page, SHIFT + T to open a new tab, and SHIFT + U to open another URL. If you get stuck, you can type w3m in the terminal to get help or check out its repository at GitHub to interact with its community.

Installing w3m
$ sudo apt install w3m w3m-img [Ubuntu/Debian]
The command will install the w3m package along with an image extension for in-line image support.

$ sudo dnf install w3m [Fedora]
To get started, type w3m followed by the URL of the website or the resource you want to access.

2. Lynx
Lynx
Lynx fosslinux.com

Lynx is an open-source, lightweight, text-based web browser. The project has been under development since 1992, making it one of the oldest web browsers available. It works well with a large community supporting its development and maintenance. Currently, Thomas Dickey is the chief maintainer and contributor of the project.

Lynx displays only the text part of a Web page and ignores images, video, etc. In essence, Web content is shown in the same way as seen by a search engine bot. As such, you can use it to test a website for any search-engine crawling problems. To get started, type the command lynx on a terminal prompt that displays different types of information and web content in different colors. For example, the ordinary text is displayed in white or violet, bold text in red, italic text in blue, hyperlinks in green, whereas currently highlighted hyperlinks in yellow.

The command-line utility loads fast and take less time to load a website than any GUI browser. It can come in handy in a situation when you have to do with a low-bandwidth Internet connection. You can open a website by typing lynx <website name> in the command line. Lynx is also conscious of users’ privacy. It does not track user information and doesn’t contain embedded tracking elements hidden in many web pages. It supports cookies but prompts you to allow or deny a cookie every time it loads a website.

Moreover, it can act as a text-to-speech application, or you can use it to view files and directories on your local system. You have to provide a name as an argument to the Lynx command. For example, to open the file (foss.tx), you can type lynx <i>foss</i>.txt.
If you are already intrigued, you will like that Lynx is highly configurable. You can use the ‘lynx -help’ command to get a list of more than 200+ configurable options to get the best out of your browser.



One caveat is that Lynx cannot display images, videos, Flash, or JavaScript objects. However, you can configure it to open an external program to manage videos. This configuration is not enabled by default. Moreover, Lynx does not support multiple downloads. The download process also runs in the foreground, which blocks you from doing anything else on the browser until the download completes.

Installing Lynx
$ sudo apt-get install lynx [Debian, Mint & Ubuntu]
$ sudo yum install lynx [RHEL, CentOS ]
$ sudo dnf install lynx [Fedora]
# zypper install links [suse & openSUSE]
$ sudo pacman -S lynx [ArchLinux & Manjaro]

One caveat is that it lacks support for Javascript or a graphic mode. However, it provides an excellent feature to view images on a web page. For example, if you click the placeholder for the image or highlight an image and press v on your keyboard, it opens the image with apps like GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
