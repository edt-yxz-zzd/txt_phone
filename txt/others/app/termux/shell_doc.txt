Here Documents
   This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the
   current source until a line containing only delimiter (with no trailing
   blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up to that point are then used
   as the standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified) for a
   command.

   The format of here-documents is:

          [n]<<[-]word
                  here-document
          delimiter

   No parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
   expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on word.  If any part of
   word is quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word,
   and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.  If word is
   unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter
   expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the
   character sequence \<newline> is ignored, and \ must be used to quote
   the characters \, $, and `.

   If the redirection operator is <<-, then all leading tab characters are
   stripped from input lines and the line containing delimiter.  This
   allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural
   fashion.

Here Strings
   A variant of here documents, the format is:

          [n]<<<word

   The word undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
   command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.
   Pathname expansion and word splitting are not performed.  The result is
   supplied as a single string, with a newline appended, to the command on
   its standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified).
