NOTE
       This manpage is a short description of GNU tar.  For a detailed
       discussion, including examples and usage recommendations, refer to the
       GNU Tar Manual available in texinfo format.  If the info reader and the
       tar documentation are properly installed on your system, the command

           info tar

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       You can also view the manual using the info mode in emacs(1), or find
       it in various formats online at

           http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual

       If any discrepancies occur between this manpage and the GNU Tar Manual,
       the later shall be considered the authoritative source.

DESCRIPTION
       GNU tar is an archiving program designed to store multiple files in a
       single file (an archive), and to manipulate such archives.  The archive
       can be either a regular file or a device (e.g. a tape drive, hence the
       name of the program, which stands for tape archiver), which can be
       located either on the local or on a remote machine.

   Option styles
       Options to GNU tar can be given in three different styles.  In
       traditional style, the first argument is a cluster of option letters
       and all subsequent arguments supply arguments to those options that
       require them.  The arguments are read in the same order as the option
       letters.  Any command line words that remain after all options has been
       processed are treated as non-optional arguments: file or archive member
       names.

       For example, the c option requires creating the archive, the v option
       requests the verbose operation, and the f option takes an argument that
       sets the name of the archive to operate upon.  The following command,
       written in the traditional style, instructs tar to store all files from
       the directory /etc into the archive file etc.tar verbosely listing the
       files being archived:

       tar cfv etc.tar /etc

       In UNIX or short-option style, each option letter is prefixed with a
       single dash, as in other command line utilities.  If an option takes
       argument, the argument follows it, either as a separate command line
       word, or immediately following the option.  However, if the option
       takes an optional argument, the argument must follow the option letter
       without any intervening whitespace, as in -g/tmp/snar.db.

       Any number of options not taking arguments can be clustered together
       after a single dash, e.g. -vkp.  Options that take arguments (whether
       mandatory or optional), can appear at the end of such a cluster, e.g.
       -vkpf a.tar.

       The example command above written in the short-option style could look
       like:

       tar -cvf etc.tar /etc
       or
       tar -c -v -f etc.tar /etc

       In GNU or long-option style, each option begins with two dashes and has
       a meaningful name, consisting of lower-case letters and dashes.  When
       used, the long option can be abbreviated to its initial letters,
       provided that this does not create ambiguity.  Arguments to long
       options are supplied either as a separate command line word,
       immediately following the option, or separated from the option by an
       equals sign with no intervening whitespace.  Optional arguments must
       always use the latter method.

       Here are several ways of writing the example command in this style:

       tar --create --file etc.tar --verbose /etc
       or (abbreviating some options):
       tar --cre --file=etc.tar --verb /etc

       The options in all three styles can be intermixed, although doing so
       with old options is not encouraged.

   Operation mode
       The options listed in the table below tell GNU tar what operation it is
       to perform.  Exactly one of them must be given.  Meaning of non-
       optional arguments depends on the operation mode requested.

       -A, --catenate, --concatenate
              Append archive to the end of another archive.  The arguments are
              treated as the names of archives to append.  All archives must
              be of the same format as the archive they are appended to,
              otherwise the resulting archive might be unusable with non-GNU
              implementations of tar.  Notice also that when more than one
              archive is given, the members from archives other than the first
              one will be accessible in the resulting archive only if using
              the -i (--ignore-zeros) option.

              Compressed archives cannot be concatenated.

       -c, --create
              Create a new archive.  Arguments supply the names of the files
              to be archived.  Directories are archived recursively, unless
              the --no-recursion option is given.

       -d, --diff, --compare
              Find differences between archive and file system.  The arguments
              are optional and specify archive members to compare.  If not
              given, the current working directory is assumed.

       --delete
              Delete from the archive.  The arguments supply names of the
              archive members to be removed.  At least one argument must be
              given.

              This option does not operate on compressed archives.  There is
              no short option equivalent.

       -r, --append
              Append files to the end of an archive.  Arguments have the same
              meaning as for -c (--create).

       -t, --list
              List the contents of an archive.  Arguments are optional.  When
              given, they specify the names of the members to list.

       --test-label
              Test the archive volume label and exit.  When used without
              arguments, it prints the volume label (if any) and exits with
              status 0.  When one or more command line arguments are given.
              tar compares the volume label with each argument.  It exits with
              code 0 if a match is found, and with code 1 otherwise.  No
              output is displayed, unless used together with the -v
              (--verbose) option.

              There is no short option equivalent for this option.

       -u, --update
              Append files which are newer than the corresponding copy in the
              archive.  Arguments have the same meaning as with -c and -r
              options.  Notice, that newer files don't replace their old
              archive copies, but instead are appended to the end of archive.
              The resulting archive can thus contain several members of the
              same name, corresponding to various versions of the same file.

       -x, --extract, --get
              Extract files from an archive.  Arguments are optional.  When
              given, they specify names of the archive members to be
              extracted.

       --show-defaults
              Show built-in defaults for various tar options and exit.  No
              arguments are allowed.

       -?, --help
              Display a short option summary and exit.  No arguments allowed.

       --usage
              Display a list of available options and exit.  No arguments
              allowed.

       --version
              Print program version and copyright information and exit.

OPTIONS
   Operation modifiers
       --check-device
              Check device numbers when creating incremental archives
              (default).

       -g, --listed-incremental=____
              Handle new GNU-format incremental backups.  ____ is the name of
              a snapshot file, where tar stores additional information which
              is used to decide which files changed since the previous
              incremental dump and, consequently, must be dumped again.  If
              ____ does not exist when creating an archive, it will be created
              and all files will be added to the resulting archive (the level
              0 dump).  To create incremental archives of non-zero level N,
              create a copy of the snapshot file created during the level N-1,
              and use it as ____.

              When listing or extracting, the actual contents of ____ is not
              inspected, it is needed only due to syntactical requirements.
              It is therefore common practice to use /dev/null in its place.

       --hole-detection=______
              Use ______ to detect holes in sparse files.  This option implies
              --sparse.  Valid values for ______ are seek and raw.  Default is
              seek with fallback to raw when not applicable.

       -G, --incremental
              Handle old GNU-format incremental backups.

       --ignore-failed-read
              Do not exit with nonzero on unreadable files.

       --level=______
              Set dump level for created listed-incremental archive.
              Currently only --level=0 is meaningful: it instructs tar to
              truncate the snapshot file before dumping, thereby forcing a
              level 0 dump.

       -n, --seek
              Assume the archive is seekable.  Normally tar determines
              automatically whether the archive can be seeked or not.  This
              option is intended for use in cases when such recognition fails.
              It takes effect only if the archive is open for reading (e.g.
              with --list or --extract options).

       --no-check-device
              Do not check device numbers when creating incremental archives.

       --no-seek
              Assume the archive is not seekable.

       --occurrence[=_]
              Process only the _th occurrence of each file in the archive.
              This option is valid only when used with one of the following
              subcommands: --delete, --diff, --extract or --list and when a
              list of files is given either on the command line or via the -T
              option.  The default _ is 1.

       --restrict
              Disable the use of some potentially harmful options.

       --sparse-version=_____[._____]
              Set version of the sparse format to use (implies --sparse).
              This option implies --sparse.  Valid argument values are 0.0,
              0.1, and 1.0.  For a detailed discussion of sparse formats,
              refer to the GNU Tar Manual, appendix D, "Sparse Formats".
              Using info reader, it can be accessed running the following
              command: info tar 'Sparse Formats'.

       -S, --sparse
              Handle sparse files efficiently.  Some files in the file system
              may have segments which were actually never written (quite often
              these are database files created by such systems as DBM).  When
              given this option, tar attempts to determine if the file is
              sparse prior to archiving it, and if so, to reduce the resulting
              archive size by not dumping empty parts of the file.

   Overwrite control
       These options control tar actions when extracting a file over an
       existing copy on disk.

       -k, --keep-old-files
              Don't replace existing files when extracting.

       --keep-newer-files
              Don't replace existing files that are newer than their archive
              copies.

       --keep-directory-symlink
              Don't replace existing symlinks to directories when extracting.

       --no-overwrite-dir
              Preserve metadata of existing directories.

       --one-top-level[=___]
              Extract all files into ___, or, if used without argument, into a
              subdirectory named by the base name of the archive (minus
              standard compression suffixes recognizable by --auto-compress).

       --overwrite
              Overwrite existing files when extracting.

       --overwrite-dir
              Overwrite metadata of existing directories when extracting
              (default).

       --recursive-unlink
              Recursively remove all files in the directory prior to
              extracting it.

       --remove-files
              Remove files from disk after adding them to the archive.

       --skip-old-files
              Don't replace existing files when extracting, silently skip over
              them.

       -U, --unlink-first
              Remove each file prior to extracting over it.

       -W, --verify
              Verify the archive after writing it.

   Output stream selection
       --ignore-command-error

       Ignore subprocess exit codes.

       --no-ignore-command-error
              Treat non-zero exit codes of children as error (default).

       -O, --to-stdout
              Extract files to standard output.

       --to-command=_______
              Pipe extracted files to _______.  The argument is the pathname
              of an external program, optionally with command line arguments.
              The program will be invoked and the contents of the file being
              extracted supplied to it on its standard input.  Additional data
              will be supplied via the following environment variables:

              TAR_FILETYPE
                     Type of the file. It is a single letter with the
                     following meaning:

                             f           Regular file
                             d           Directory
                             l           Symbolic link
                             h           Hard link
                             b           Block device
                             c           Character device

                     Currently only regular files are supported.

              TAR_ATIME
                     Time of last access. It is a decimal number, representing
                     seconds since the Epoch.  If the archive provides times
                     with nanosecond precision, the nanoseconds are appended
                     to the timestamp after a decimal point.

                     Current blocking factor, i.e. number of 512-byte blocks
                     in a record.

              TAR_VOLUME
                     Ordinal number of the volume tar is processing (set if
                     reading a multi-volume archive).

       --atime-preserve[=______]
              Preserve access times on dumped files, either by restoring the
              times after reading (______=replace, this is the default) or by
              not setting the times in the first place (______=system)

       --delay-directory-restore
              Delay setting modification times and permissions of extracted
              directories until the end of extraction.  Use this option when
              extracting from an archive which has unusual member ordering.

       --group=____[:___]
              Force ____ as group for added files.  If ___ is not supplied,
              ____ can be either a user name or numeric GID.  In this case the
              missing part (GID or name) will be inferred from the current
              host's group database.

              When used with --group-map=____, affects only those files whose
              owner group is not listed in ____.

       --group-map=____
              Read group translation map from ____.  Empty lines are ignored.
              Comments are introduced with # sign and extend to the end of
              line.  Each non-empty line in ____ defines translation for a
              single group.  It must consist of two fields, delimited by any
              amount of whitespace:

              ______ ______[:______]

              ______ is either a valid group name or a GID prefixed with +.
              Unless ______ is supplied, ______ must also be either a valid
              group name or a +___.  Otherwise, both ______ and ______ need
              not be listed in the system group database.

              As a result, each input file with owner group ______ will be
              stored in archive with owner group ______ and GID ______.

       --mode=_______
              Force symbolic mode _______ for added files.

       --mtime=____________
              Set mtime for added files.  ____________ is either a date/time
              in almost arbitrary format, or the name of an existing file.  In
              the latter case the mtime of that file will be used.

       -m, --touch
              Don't extract file modified time.

       --no-delay-directory-restore
              Cancel the effect of the prior --delay-directory-restore option.

       --no-same-owner
              Extract files as yourself (default for ordinary users).

       --no-same-permissions
              Apply the user's umask when extracting permissions from the
              archive (default for ordinary users).

       --numeric-owner
              Always use numbers for user/group names.

       --owner=____[:___]
              Force ____ as owner for added files.  If ___ is not supplied,
              ____ can be either a user name or numeric UID.  In this case the
              missing part (UID or name) will be inferred from the current
              host's user database.

              When used with --owner-map=____, affects only those files whose
              owner is not listed in ____.

       --owner-map=____
              Read owner translation map from ____.  Empty lines are ignored.
              Comments are introduced with # sign and extend to the end of
              line.  Each non-empty line in ____ defines translation for a
              single UID.  It must consist of two fields, delimited by any
              amount of whitespace:

              ______ ______[:______]

              ______ is either a valid user name or a UID prefixed with +.
              Unless ______ is supplied, ______ must also be either a valid
              user name or a +___.  Otherwise, both ______ and ______ need not
              be listed in the system user database.

              As a result, each input file owned by ______ will be stored in
              archive with owner name ______ and UID ______.

       -p, --preserve-permissions, --same-permissions
              extract information about file permissions (default for
              superuser)

       --same-owner
              Try extracting files with the same ownership as exists in the
              archive (default for superuser).

       -s, --preserve-order, --same-order
              Sort names to extract to match archive

       --sort=_____
              When creating an archive, sort directory entries according to
              _____, which is one of none, name, or inode.

              The default is --sort=none, which stores archive members in the
              same order as returned by the operating system.

              Using --sort=name ensures the member ordering in the created
              archive is uniform and reproducible.

              Using --sort=inode reduces the number of disk seeks made when
              creating the archive and thus can considerably speed up
              archivation.  This sorting order is supported only if the
              underlying system provides the necessary information.

   Extended file attributes
       --acls Enable POSIX ACLs support.

       --no-acls
              Disable POSIX ACLs support.

       --selinux
              Enable SELinux context support.

       --no-selinux
              Disable SELinux context support.

       --xattrs
              Enable extended attributes support.

       --no-xattrs
              Disable extended attributes support.

       --xattrs-exclude=_______
              Specify the exclude pattern for xattr keys.  _______ is a POSIX
              regular expression, e.g. --xattrs-exclude='^user.', to exclude
              attributes from the user namespace.

       --xattrs-include=_______
              Specify the include pattern for xattr keys.  _______ is a POSIX
              regular expression.

   Device selection and switching
       -f, --file=_______
              Use archive file or device _______.  If this option is not
              given, tar will first examine the environment variable `TAPE'.
              If it is set, its value will be used as the archive name.
              Otherwise, tar will assume the compiled-in default.  The default
              value can be inspected either using the --show-defaults option,
              or at the end of the tar --help output.

              An archive name that has a colon in it specifies a file or
              device on a remote machine.  The part before the colon is taken
              as the machine name or IP address, and the part after it as the
              file or device pathname, e.g.:

              --file=remotehost:/dev/sr0

              An optional username can be prefixed to the hostname, placing a
              @ sign between them.

              By default, the remote host is accessed via the rsh(1) command.
              Nowadays it is common to use ssh(1) instead.  You can do so by
              giving the following command line option:

              --rsh-command=/usr/bin/ssh

              The remote machine should have the rmt(8) command installed.  If
              its pathname does not match tar's default, you can inform tar
              about the correct pathname using the --rmt-command option.

       --force-local
              Archive file is local even if it has a colon.

       -F, --info-script=_______, --new-volume-script=_______
              Run _______ at the end of each tape (implies -M).  The command
              can include arguments.  When started, it will inherit tar's
              environment plus the following variables:

              TAR_VERSION
                     GNU tar version number.

              TAR_ARCHIVE
                     The name of the archive tar is processing.

              TAR_BLOCKING_FACTOR
                     Current blocking factor, i.e. number of 512-byte blocks
                     in a record.

              TAR_VOLUME
                     Ordinal number of the volume tar is processing (set if
                     reading a multi-volume archive).

              TAR_FORMAT
                     Format of the archive being processed.  One of: gnu,
                     oldgnu, posix, ustar, v7.

              TAR_SUBCOMMAND
                     A short option (with a leading dash) describing the
                     operation tar is executing.

              TAR_FD File descriptor which can be used to communicate the new
                     volume name to tar.

              If the info script fails, tar exits; otherwise, it begins
              writing the next volume.

       -L, --tape-length=_
              Change tape after writing _x1024 bytes.  If _ is followed by a
              size suffix (see the subsection Size suffixes below), the suffix
              specifies the multiplicative factor to be used instead of 1024.

              This option implies -M.

       -M, --multi-volume
              Create/list/extract multi-volume archive.

       --rmt-command=_______
              Use _______ instead of rmt when accessing remote archives.  See
              the description of the -f option, above.

       --rsh-command=_______
              Use _______ instead of rsh when accessing remote archives.  See
              the description of the -f option, above.

       --volno-file=____
              When this option is used in conjunction with --multi-volume, tar
              will keep track of which volume of a multi-volume archive it is
              working in ____.

   Device blocking
       -b, --blocking-factor=______
              Set record size to ______x512 bytes.

       -B, --read-full-records
              When listing or extracting, accept incomplete input records
              after end-of-file marker.

       -i, --ignore-zeros
              Ignore zeroed blocks in archive.  Normally two consecutive
              512-blocks filled with zeroes mean EOF and tar stops reading
              after encountering them.  This option instructs it to read
              further and is useful when reading archives created with the -A
              option.

       --record-size=______
              Set record size.  ______ is the number of bytes per record.  It
              must be multiple of 512.  It can can be suffixed with a size
              suffix, e.g. --record-size=10K, for 10 Kilobytes.  See the
              subsection Size suffixes, for a list of valid suffixes.

   Archive format selection
       -H, --format=______
              Create archive of the given format.  Valid formats are:

              gnu    GNU tar 1.13.x format

              oldgnu GNU format as per tar <= 1.12.

              pax, posix
                     POSIX 1003.1-2001 (pax) format.

              v7     Old V7 tar format.

       --old-archive, --portability
              Same as --format=v7.

       --pax-option=_______[[:]=_____][,_______[[:]=_____]]...
              Control pax keywords when creating PAX archives (-H pax).  This
              option is equivalent to the -o option of the pax(1)utility.

       --posix
              Same as --format=posix.

       -V, --label=____
              Create archive with volume name ____.  If listing or extracting,
              use ____ as a globbing pattern for volume name.

   Compression options
       -a, --auto-compress
              Use archive suffix to determine the compression program.

       -I, --use-compress-program________
              Filter data through _______.  It must accept the -d option, for
              decompression.  The argument can contain command line options.

       -j, --bzip2
              Filter the archive through bzip2(1).

       -J, --xz
              Filter the archive through xz(1).

       --lzip Filter the archive through lzip(1).

       -Z, --compress, --uncompress
              Filter the archive through compress(1).

       --zstd Filter the archive through zstd(1).

   Local file selection
       --add-file=____
              Add ____ to the archive (useful if its name starts with a dash).

       --backup[=_______]
              Backup before removal.  The _______ argument, if supplied,
              controls the backup policy.  Its valid values are:

              none, off
                     Never make backups.

              t, numbered
                     Make numbered backups.

              nil, existing
                     Make numbered backups if numbered backups exist, simple
                     backups otherwise.

              never, simple
                     Always make simple backups

              If _______ is not given, the value is taken from the
              VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  If it is not set,
              existing is assumed.

       -C, --directory=___
              Change to ___ before performing any operations.  This option is
              order-sensitive, i.e. it affects all options that follow.

       --exclude=_______

              Exclude directories containing file CACHEDIR.TAG and the file
              itself.

       --exclude-caches-under
              Exclude everything under directories containing CACHEDIR.TAG

       --exclude-ignore=____
              Before dumping a directory, see if it contains ____.  If so,
              read exclusion patterns from this file.  The patterns affect
              only the directory itself.

       --exclude-ignore-recursive=____
              Same as --exclude-ignore, except that patterns from ____ affect
              both the directory and all its subdirectories.

       --exclude-tag=____
              Exclude contents of directories containing ____, except for ____
              itself.

       --exclude-tag-all=____
              Exclude directories containing ____.

       --exclude-tag-under=____
              Exclude everything under directories containing ____.

       --exclude-vcs
              Exclude version control system directories.

       --exclude-vcs-ignores
              Exclude files that match patterns read from VCS-specific ignore
              files.  Supported files are: .cvsignore, .gitignore, .bzrignore,
              and .hgignore.

              Follow hard links; archive and dump the files they refer to.

       -K, --starting-file=______
              Begin at the given member in the archive.

       --newer-mtime=____
              Work on files whose data changed after the ____.  If ____ starts
              with / or . it is taken to be a file name; the mtime of that
              file is used as the date.

       --no-null
              Disable the effect of the previous --null option.

       --no-recursion
              Avoid descending automatically in directories.

       --no-unquote
              Do not unquote input file or member names.

       --no-verbatim-files-from
              Treat each line read from a file list as if it were supplied in
              the command line.  I.e., leading and trailing whitespace is
              removed and, if the resulting string begins with a dash, it is
              treated as tar command line option.

              This is the default behavior.  The --no-verbatim-files-from
              option is provided as a way to restore it after
              --verbatim-files-from option.

              This option is positional: it affects all --files-from options
              that occur after it in, until --verbatim-files-from option or
              end of line, whichever occurs first.

              It is implied by the --no-null option.

       --null Instruct subsequent -T options to read null-terminated names
              verbatim (disables special handling of names that start with a
              dash).

              See also --verbatim-files-from.

       -N, --newer=____, --after-date=____
              Only store files newer than DATE.  If ____ starts with / or . it
              is taken to be a file name; the ctime of that file is used as
              the date.

       --one-file-system
              Stay in local file system when creating archive.

       -P, --absolute-names
              Don't strip leading slashes from file names when creating
              archives.

       --recursion
              Recurse into directories (default).

       --suffix=______
              Backup before removal, override usual suffix.  Default suffix is
              ~, unless overridden by environment variable
              SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.

       -T, --files-from=____
              Get names to extract or create from ____.

              Unless specified otherwise, the ____ must contain a list of
              names separated by ASCII LF (i.e. one name per line).  The names
              read are handled the same way as command line arguments.  They
              undergo quote removal and word splitting, and any string that
              starts with a - is handled as tar command line option.

              If this behavior is undesirable, it can be turned off using the
              --verbatim-files-from option.

              The --null option instructs tar that the names in ____ are
              separated by ASCII NUL character, instead of LF.  It is useful
              if the list is generated by find(1) -print0 predicate.

       --unquote
              Unquote file or member names (default).

       --verbatim-files-from
              Treat each line obtained from a file list as a file name, even
              if it starts with a dash.  File lists are supplied with the
              --files-from (-T) option.  The default behavior is to handle
              names supplied in file lists as if they were typed in the
              command line, i.e. any names starting with a dash are treated as
              tar options.  The --verbatim-files-from option disables this
              behavior.

              This option affects all --files-from options that occur after it
              in the command line.  Its effect is reverted by the
              --no-verbatim-files-from} option.

              This option is implied by the --null option.

              See also --add-file.

       -X, --exclude-from=____
              Exclude files matching patterns listed in FILE.

   File name transformations

              none   Disable all warning messages.

              filename-with-nuls

                     "%s: socket ignored"
                     "%s: door ignored"

              ignore-archive
                     "%s: file is the archive; not dumped"

              file-removed
                     "%s: File removed before we read it"

              file-changed
                     "%s: file changed as we read it"

              failed-read
                     Suppresses warnings about unreadable files or
                     directories. This keyword applies only if used together
                     with the --ignore-failed-read option.

              Keywords applicable for tar --extract:

              existing-file
                     "%s: skipping existing file"

              timestamp

              decompress-program
                     Controls verbose description of failures occurring when
                     trying to run alternative decompressor programs.  This
                     warning is disabled by default (unless --verbose is
                     used).  A common example of what you can get when using
                     this warning is:

                     $ tar --warning=decompress-program -x -f archive.Z
                     tar (child): cannot run compress: No such file or directory
                     tar (child): trying gzip

                     This means that tar first tried to decompress archive.Z
                     using compress, and, when that failed, switched to gzip.

              record-size
                     "Record size = %lu blocks"

              Keywords controlling incremental extraction:

                     "%s: Directory has been renamed from %s"
                     "%s: Directory has been renamed"

              new-directory
                     "%s: Directory is new"

              xdev   "%s: directory is on a different device: not purging"

              bad-dumpdir
                     "Malformed dumpdir: 'X' never used"

       -w, --interactive, --confirmation
              Ask for confirmation for every action.

   Compatibility options
       -o     When creating, same as --old-archive.  When extracting, same as
              --no-same-owner.

               w         Words                   ____ x 2

RETURN VALUE
       Tar exit code indicates whether it was able to successfully perform the
       requested operation, and if not, what kind of error occurred.

       0      Successful termination.

       1      ____ _____ _______  If tar was invoked with the --compare
              (--diff, -d) command line option, this means that some files in
              the archive differ from their disk counterparts.  If tar was
              given one of the --create, --append or --update options, this
              exit code means that some files were changed while being
              archived and so the resulting archive does not contain the exact
              copy of the file set.

       2      _____ ______  This means that some fatal, unrecoverable error
              occurred.

       If a subprocess that had been invoked by tar exited with a nonzero exit
       code, tar itself exits with that code as well.  This can happen, for
       example, if a compression option (e.g. -z) was used and the external
       compressor program failed.  Another example is rmt failure during
       backup to a remote device.
