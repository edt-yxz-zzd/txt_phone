ctime vs mtime

mtime <= ctime

ctime is the inode or file change time. The ctime gets updated when the file attributes are changed, like changing the owner, changing the permission or moving the file to an other filesystem but will also be updated when you modify a file.
mtime is the file modify time. The mtime gets updated when you modify a file.
