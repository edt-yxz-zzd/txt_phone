Whilst an endomorphism is a morphism or homomorphism from a mathematical object to itself, the technical term for a function that has a domain equal to it's co-domain is called an endofunction.

NB: A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism.

Edit: From Wikipedia:

  Let S be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on S one finds permutations of S and constant functions associating to each x∈S a given c∈S.

  Every permutation of S has the codomain equal to its domain and is bijective and invertible.

  A constant function on S, if S has more than 1 element, has a codomain that is a proper subset of its domain, is not bijective (and non invertible).

  The function associating to each natural integer n the floor of n/2 has its co-domain equal to its domain and is not invertible.

  Finite endofunctions are equivalent to directed pseudoforests. For sets of size n there are n**n endofunctions on the set.

  Particular bijective endofunctions are the involutions, i.e. the functions coinciding with their inverses.

---
  @danza: for example, the constant function on the integers f(n)=1, is not a homomorphism with respect to addition, since it fails to map the identity element of the domain to the identity element of the codomain.
  But that text from Wikipedia appears to be using "codomain" to refer to what I'd call the "range" of a function, so a better example might be g(n)=n+1.
  Of course one can still "find" the structure of the domain in the structure of the codomain, even though it doesn't satisfy g(n+m)=g(n)+g(m), but there are much "messier" permutations of Z if you prefer! – Steve Jessop Jul 10, 2015 at 1:39

Codomain of a function

Since you may be dealing with functions and relations unto their depths, knowing better about domain and range sets would be considerable.
Codomain of a function

The codomain of a function is known to be its set of possible outputs. In other words, codomain is a set of elements that may possibly and logically be produced by the function and the inputs that may be entered.

For instance, consider the use of function notation f: R→R, It would certainly mean that f is a function from real number to real number. In other words, it could be said that the codomain of f is a set of real numbers R (also the set of its possible inputs or domains is also supposed to be a set of real numbers RR).

Now, just because an object exists as the codomain of a function, it does not imply that it would come out as an outcome for the inputs entered for the function. Consider an example,

Suppose that we have defined a function f: R→R,

. Here, since f(x) would always be non-negative, the number -3 despite being a codomain of the function cannot come out as an outcome since there are no inputs that could actually result in a negative outcome. The set of all outputs that would be received from putting in all inputs into the function is called range. While range is a set of non-negative real numbers, codomain is a set of all considerable real numbers.

It may now be clear to you that a “codomain of a relation or a function is a set of values which include the range as explained earlier and can include additional values apart from the ones in the range.

Codomains are of importance in the following cases:

    When you are required to restrict the outputs of a considered function. For instance, by specifying a codomain as a “set of positive real numbers”, you may be instructing the ones who’re ignoring any negative values while using the function.
    It might be difficult to specify the range exactly. However, a larger set of numbers that includes a few that could possibly be the part of the range can surely be specified. For instance, a codomain could define a set of entirely positive real numbers even though; a function does not generate all positive real numbers.

Since the range is quite difficult to be specified, thinking about the codomain could help in attaining the range.

What is the difference between codomain and image?
is that codomain is (mathematics) the target space into which a function maps elements of its domain it always contains the range of the function, but can be larger than the range if the function is not surjective while image is (mathematics) the subset of a codomain comprising those elements that are images of something.

Suppose that f:X→Y is a function.
If E is a set, then f(E) (i.e. the set of all f(x) such that x is in E) is called the image of E under f.
    Why "image"? Mainly because you have to call it something, and what else would you call it? It makes some sense to call it "image", if you think of X as a shape that's turned into something else by f.
  The range of f is the specific set f(X), i.e. the image of the domain.
      So image and range don't mean exactly the same thing.
      The term "range" is natural, since f(X) is the set of all members of the codomain Y that are "reached" by the function f. f(X)={f(x)|x in X}={y in Y|there's an x in X such that f(x)=y}.
  ###
  # I disagree with this. There are two common usages of the word range. One usage of the word range is the same as the image of a function, which is the usage you describe above. The other usage is for the codomain of the function. Both conventions are fairly common.


Also, span and range don't mean the same thing, but you probably know that. The span of a subset of a vector space is the smallest vector subspace that contains the set, or equivalently, the set of all linear combinations of members of the set.
]

[
The term 'image' as in 'image of a function' originated in a slightly different usage.

The 'image of a point' under a function is the value of the function there, so if y=f(x), then y is the image of x. (We also say x is a 'preimage' of y.)

Another term that's often used is the 'image of a set under a function,' which refers to the set of all images of points in the set. For instance, the image of the iterval [-∞,-2] under the squaring operation is the interval [4,∞].

The 'image of a function' X→Y just refers to the image of X under the function. Range and image mean the same thing, and range has a more intuitive origin, like you mentioned.

Usage of 'span' is pretty much isolated to linear algebra.

 I'm very surprised by these comments. Are there really books that define "range" so that f(X) can be a proper subset of the range of f? If you all have seen it, then I guess I have to believe it, but honestly, if it had been only two of you saying it instead of three, I would have assumed that you're both really drunk. :smile:

 OK, I need to think this through to see if I can make sense of it. I will write down my thoughts. (Sorry, this will be a long post, but it will at least be useful to everyone who wants to understand the definitions of the term "function").


 The idea behind the definition of "function" is that we should be able to think of a function f:X→Y as a rule that takes each member of the set X to exactly one member of the set Y. But to properly define the term in the framework of ZFC set theory, we must specify which set f is. Since there are many sets that we can think of as representing a rule like that, there are also many ways to make the concept of "function" (that we already understand on an intuitive level) mathematically precise. These are two similar, but not equivalent, ways to make the concept mathematically precise:

 Definition 1
  A set f |<=| X*Y is said to be a function from X into Y, if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
    <==>
      [@x<-X. ?y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
      [@x<-X. @y1,y2<-Y. [(x,y1),(x,y2)<-f] -> [y1===y2]]

  X is said to be the domain of f.
  Y is said to be a codomain of f.
  f is also called the graph of f.
    So the function and its graph is the same thing.
        ----under Definition 1

 Definition 2
  A triple f=(X,Y,G) is said to be a function from X into Y, if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-G]]
  X is said to be the domain of f.
  Y is said to be the codomain of f.
  G is said to be the graph of f.

If we use definition 1, then a function has many codomains. If f is a function from X into Y and Y is a subset of Z, then Z is also a codomain of f.

If we use definition 2, each function has exactly one codomain.

Definition 1 is slightly simpler, and seems to be the more popular one in the literature. It also seems desirable to have a definition that only admits one function that (for example) "takes every real number to its square".

If we use definition 2, there are infinitely many such functions. For example, there's one with codomain {x in ℝ|x≥0}, one with codomain ℝ, one with codomain ℂ, etc.

But definition 2 at least has the advantage that it makes phrases like "f is surjective" unambiguous. If f is a function from X into Y, then it can only mean that f is surjective onto Y. But if we use definition 1, and Y is a subset of Z, it can also mean that f is surjective onto Z.

If we use one of these definitions, then it seems very strange to me to use the word "range" for the set Y. For example, the complex number -1+i would be in the range of the function defined by f(n)=n+1 for all natural numbers n. This makes me wonder if there is any English word that would be less appropriate here than "range". Maybe those 7 words that George Carlin liked to talk about.

There is however a definition that doesn't require us to mention the codomain (or even the domain) at all. The trick is to first define an ordered pair (a,b) (where a and b are arbitrary sets) by (a,b)={{a},{a,b}}.


 Definition 3
  A set f whose members are ordered pairs is said to be a function if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
    [@(x,y1)<-f. @(x,y2)<-f. [y1===y2]]
      ---same as Definition 1???
      ---   no X,Y, only f
      ---       X,Y are derived by f

If we use this definition, then it wouldn't make much sense to define the term "codomain" at all. We would define the domain X by ...
The range f(X) can be defined similarly.

I think this approach is much harder to understand (we need to know things like why ⋃(⋃f) is a set), so I wouldn't recommend it. The concept of "codomain" seems to be unnecessary, but if it makes the definitions simpler, then I don't mind using it.

Conclusion: I can see why someone might want to leave out the word "codomain", but not why anyone would want to define "range" differently. To be honest, I'm thinking that if it's really common to call the codomain "the range", then it's probably like the pronunciation "nucular" (damn you Jack Bauer) or the word "irregardless". It started with a misunderstanding, and then people started copying the mistake. Finally, so many people were doing it wrong that we started saying that it's not wrong anymore.

By the way, someone who doesn't have "codomain" in their vocabulary, and defines the range of f as the set f(X), shouldn't have any use for the term "surjective" (="onto"), because every function is surjective onto its range.

One of the reasons why I have no idea what terminology is common in English is that I first learned this from a book written in Swedish. The sets X,Y and f(X) were respectively called "definitionsmängd" (=definition set), "målmängd" (target set) and "värdemängd" (value set). I think those terms are much more intuitive than the English ones.


 I believe definitions 1 and 3 are equivalent: given a function according to definition 3, we simply let X = {x:there exists some y s.t. (x,y) in f}. Then we have sufficient information to apply definition 1, and see that they agree. (The reverse agreement is trivial.) X never needs to be specified, because that information is encoded in the graph (the set f, that is). It's only Y that is sometimes necessary to make explicit, if we want to talk about surjectivity. Really the only difference between 1/3 and 2 is that 1/3 make the codomain explicit. The 2-functions can be considered as functions from f into our universe of consideration, which are necessarily never surjective. However, the codomain is key anytime we want to consider an algebra of functions (that is, in any category), since each object has a distinct identity map. (If distinct objects had the same identity endomorphism, we would probably find some odd pathologies.)

The codomain of a function X→Y is Y, which I believe is the range in your usage. In my experience, however, range is used very inconsistently to refer to both meanings, but actually is more often synonymous with image.

By the way, I tutor a couple of students a precalculus class at my university, and one of the topics covered is "domain and range of functions" (always real-valued functions of a real variable). A function is not formally defined: it's considered to be an algebraic expression. The domain is either specified, or taken to be the "natural domain" of the expression which is the largest subset of R on which the expression is defined. Codomain is never specified, and the "range" sought is *always* the image. However, this interpretation doesn't quite disagree with either definition of "range," since we don't explicitly have a codomain

What is an abbreviation?

An abbreviation is a shortened form of a written word or phrase. Abbreviations may be used to save space and time, to avoid repetition of long words and phrases, or simply to conform to conventional usage.

The styling of abbreviations is inconsistent and arbitrary and includes many possible variations. Some abbreviations are formed by omitting all but the first few letters of a word; such abbreviations usually end in a period: Oct. for October, univ. for university, and cont. for continued. Other abbreviations are formed by omitting letters from the middle of the word and usually also end in a period: govt. for government, Dr. for Doctor, and atty. for attorney. Abbreviations for the names of states in the U.S. are two capitalized letters, e.g., AR for Arkansas, ME for Maine, and TX for Texas.

Acronyms are abbreviations formed from the initial letters of an expanded phrase and usually do not include periods: PR for public relations, CEO for chief executive officer, and BTW for by the way. Some acronyms are pronounced as words: FEMA for Federal Emergency Management Agency and NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Although some people assert that all acronyms not pronounced as words, such as EPA for Environmental Protection Agency, be referred to as initialisms, the term acronym is in fact applied to both.

What's the difference between an abbreviation and an acronym?

Some people are unsure of whether to call ASAP or appt abbreviations or acronyms. Both abbreviation and acronym are used to refer to a shortened form, but an acronym is a shortened form of a phrase and is usually made up of the initial letters of that phrase. For example, NATO comes from “North Atlantic Treaty Organization,” and ASAP comes from “as soon as possible.” Abbreviations, on the other hand, can be shortened forms of words or phrases, and need not necessarily be made up of the initial letters of either. ASAP and appt (for appointment) are both considered abbreviations, but only ASAP is an acronym. Acronyms are a type of abbreviation.

contiguous vs continuous
  As adjectives the difference between contiguous and continuous is that contiguous is connected; touching; abutting while continuous is without break, cessation, or interruption; without intervening time.
  ===
  One- contiguous -describes items that are adjacent to each other. The other, continuous, means never-ending.
  ===
  The word contiguous is derived from the Latin word contiguus, which means touching, bordering upon. Contiguous is an adjective, related words are contiguously, contiguousness, contiguity.
  Continuous describes something that is unbroken, whole, something that is not interrupted, a pattern that is not interrupted.

contiguous vs consecutive


===
"Continual" means happening again and again at short intervals as "continual reminders." Example: The loud trucks were a continual problem.

"Continuous" means uninterrupted, whether of time or space, as in "continuous misery," "continuous rain," or "continuous range of mountains." Example: The stormy weather was continuous.

"Consecutive" means occurring one after the other, as in "consecutive days of the week." Example: Are we to attend on consecutive days?

They are certainly not interchangeable.

Consider a sheet of paper. The sheet is contiguous: From any point on the paper you can arrive at any other point on the paper, without ever leaving the paper. If you tear the paper into two or three pieces, it is no longer contiguous: you can't reach a spot on piece B from piece A.

Then consider the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a series of consecutive whole numbers: there are no numbers missing in the series. If we instead have the numbers 1, 2, 5, we don't have consecutive numbers anymore because there are numbers missing in the middle of the list. Similarly, if you have the years 2010, 2012, and 2013 they are not consecutive because there's a year missing in the middle.

So, consecutive things can be lined up in a particular order with unit spacing, and there will be no gaps.

A contiguous thing can be linear, planar, spatial, or N-dimensional; as long as you can get from one point in the thing to any other point in the thing without leaving it, it is contiguous.

In the strictest sense, you could consider consecutive to be sort of "one-dimensionally contiguous", but I don't recommend thinking of it that way.

---
  The word for "connected throughout" is more properly "continuous". "Contiguous" would more properly be applied to a separate piece of paper that is in contact (touching) the first piece. – Jeff Y Dec 6, 2015 at 21:51

Difference between Modulo and Modulus

    Difficulty Level : Medium
    Last Updated : 08 Jun, 2021

In the world of Programming and Mathematics we often encounter the two terms “Modulo” and “Modulus”. In programming we use the operator “%” to perform modulo of two numbers. It basically finds the remainder when a number x is divided by another number N.  
It is denoted by : 

x mod N 
 where
x : Dividend 
N : Divisor

Some important links to find out more about concepts in Modular Arithmetic :

    Modular Arithmetic

    Compute n! under modulo p
    Wilson’s Theorem
    How to compute mod of a big number?
    Find value of y mod (2 raised to power x)
    Modulus Operator in C
    Modulus of Negative Numbers

In this article we are going to see the difference between the two terms, modulo and modulus, used frequently in Modular Arithmetic.

Modulo :
It is basically an operator which is denoted by “mod” and, in programming, uses “%”. It is a function which returns the remainder value when a number is divided by another number.
For example –

1. 12 mod 5 // 12 modulo 5
2. 38 ≡ 14 (mod 12) // 38,14 are congruent modulo 12

Modulus :
It is simply a noun which is the value N in the expression “x mod N”. 
We abbreviate it as N is the modulus.
For example –

1. 12 mod 3 // 3 is the modulus

In the previous example, note that the congruent modulo basically means that the difference of the two numbers is an integer multiple of the modulus 12.

    The difference of 38 and 14 is 24 and 24 is double of 12.

It is important to note that these two words can’t be interchanged as it will completely change the meaning. It would be bogus to say that –

1. 12 mod 10 // error:modulo is 10
2. 38 ≡ 14 (mod 12) // error:38,14 are congruent modulus 

In terms of English, we can conclude that modulo is a preposition, as prepositions are used before a noun to show some spatial and temporal relations of the noun modulus. The relation in modular arithmetic is the remainder when two numbers are added.

译文
求学的人，其情欲文饰一天比一天增加；求道的人，其情欲文饰则一天比一天减少。减少又减少，到最后以至于“无为”的境地。如果能够做到无为，即不妄为，任何事情都可以有所作为。治理国家的人，要经常以不骚扰人民为治国之本，如果经常以繁苛之政扰害民众，那就不配治理国家了。
注释
1、为学日益：为学，是反映探求外物的知识。此处的“学”当指政教礼乐。日益：指增加人的知见智巧。
2、为道日损：为道，是通过冥想或体验的途径，领悟事物未分化状态的“道”。此处的“道”，指自然之道，无为之道。损，指情欲文饰日渐泯损。
3、无为而无不为：不妄为，就没有什么事情做不成。
4、取：治、摄化之意。
5、无事：即无扰攘之事。
6、有事：繁苛政举在骚扰民生。
引语
本章讲“为学”和“为道”的问题。他先讲“为学”，是求外在的经验知识，经验知识愈积累愈多。老子轻视外在的经验知识，认为这种知识掌握得越多，私欲妄见也就层出不穷。“为道”和“为学”就不同一。它是透过直观体悟以把握事物未分化的状态或内索自身虚静的心境，它不断地除去私欲妄见，使人日渐返朴归真，最终可以达到“无为”的境地。这一章所讲的“为学”是反映“政教礼乐之学”，老子认为它足以产生机智巧变。只有“清静无为”，没有私欲妄见的人才可以治理国家。因而，老子希望人们走“为道”的路子。
评析
任继愈先生认为：“老子承认求学问，天天积累知识，越积累，知识越丰富。至于要认识宇宙变化的总规律或是认识宇宙的最后的根源，就不能靠积累知识，而要靠‘玄览’、‘静观’。他注重理性思维这一点是对的，指出认识总规律和认识个别的东西的方法应有所不同，也是对的。老子的错误在于把理性思维绝对化使他倒向了唯心主义，甚至陷于排斥感性知识的错误。”（《老子的研究》，《老子哲学讨论集》第23页）张松如先生说：“‘为学者日益，为道者日损’，并不是老子的一种什么神秘的、蒙昧的反理性的主张，而是一定发展中的历史现象在观念形态上的客观反映。”“本章正是从认识论和方法论上，概括了对‘礼’所作的探源与批判，而且是具有相当深刻性的。”“在这剖析过程中，由于受着不得突破的阶级的和历史的局限，在所推导的结论中，还带有一定程度的复古主义色彩，显示了骸骨迷恋的情绪，而不曾投射出向前看的目光。然而，这并不能掩盖它有关‘学’与‘道’，有关‘日益’和‘日损’的辩证思维的光辉。“（《老子校读》第281页）“无为而无不为”是老子提出来的极富智慧的命题。事实上，在中国古代，主张“无为”的学者不止老子一人，例如孔子就曾说过“无为而治者，其舜也与，夫何为哉，恭已正南面而已。”这句话的意思是，自己不做什么事情而使得天下太平的人，大概只有舜了，他做了什么呢？他只是庄重端坐在他的王位上罢了。老子把“无为”的思想发挥到极高的程度，从哲学高度来论证“无为”的社会意义。“无为”表面看来，似乎是一种后退的手段，但真正的目的，则在于避开前进中所存在的矛盾和问题，从而占据主动，以达到“无不为”的最终目的。
作者简介
老子，又称老聃、李耳，是我国古代伟大的哲学家和思想家、道家学派创始人。其被唐皇武后封为太上老君，世界文化名人，世界百位历史名人之一，存世有《道德经》（又称《老子》），其作品的精华是朴素的辨证法，主张无为而治，其学说对中国哲学发展具有深刻影响。在道教中老子被尊为道祖。
老子像
老聃（dān）（约前571～前471），字伯阳，谥号聃。又称李耳（古时“老”和“李”同音；“聃”和“耳”同义）。楚国苦县厉乡曲仁里(此地本是封于西周的陈国，今河南鹿邑，安徽涡阳存有争议）人。我国最伟大的哲学家和思 想家之一，被道教尊为教祖，世界文化名人。
作品出处
《为学日益，为道日损》出自老子的《道德经》第四十八章。
《道德经》，又称《道德真经》、《老子》、《五千言》、《老子五千文》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子（即李耳，河南鹿邑人）所撰写，是道家哲学思想的重要来源。道德经分上下两篇，原文上篇《德经》、下篇《道经》，不分章，后改为《道经》37章在前，第38章之后为《德经》，并分为81章。是中国历史上首部完整的哲学著作。
《道德经》到了公元前206年-公元200年，被奉为道教经典，所以有学者认为《道德经》被分为八十一章有明显的道教的九九归一的思想，在内容的分割上未免牵强。但道德经前三十七章讲道，后四十四章言德，简单说来，道是体，德是用，二者不能等同。至清代魏源首次破此惯例而分《道德经》为六十八章，相对保持了每章的完整性。

天道：上天的意思的体现。人道：人事。迩：近。[1] 鲁昭公十八年（前524年，郑定公六年），包括郑国在内的多个诸侯国发生火灾。据《左传》记载，此前一年（前525年，郑定公五年），郑国人裨灶就曾经预言火灾的发生，并要求用瓘、斝、玉瓒祭神，子产不答应。[6] [4] [5] 这次火灾后，裨灶又说：“不采纳我的意见，郑国还要发生火灾。”郑国人请求采纳他的意见，子产不同意。子太叔说：“宝物是用来保护百姓的。如果有了火灾，国家差不多会灭亡。可以挽救灭亡，您爱惜它干什么？”子产说：“天道悠远，人道切近，两不相关。如何由天道而知人道？灶哪里懂得天道？这个人的话多了，难道不会偶尔也说中的？”于是就不给。后来也没有再发生火灾。[2]
