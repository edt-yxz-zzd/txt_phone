元胞自动机
不同于一般的动力学模型，元胞自动机不是由严格定义的物理方程或函数确定，而是用一系列模型构造的规则构成。凡是满足这些规则的模型都可以算作是元胞自动机模型。因此，元胞自动机是一类模型的总称，或者说是一个方法框架。其特点是时间、空间、状态都离散，每个变量只取有限多个状态，且其状态改变的规则在时间和空间上都是局部的。
通俗解释
元胞自动机是一个像图1中所示的那种灯泡阵列，每个灯有“开”和“关”两种状态，每个灯与周围的8个灯相连（边上的灯会认为与另一边的相连，比如最左边的灯，会认为与最右边的灯相连。这样所有灯都与8个灯相连）。初始阶段，部分灯开部分灯关。元胞自动机像CPU一样一步一步地进行计算（如果不理解，可以参考刘慈欣《三体》里的人列计算机，有人喊号子让大家一步一步地动作）。每个元胞自动机有一个规则，来说明每个灯怎么根据之前周围8个灯及自己的状态决定自己下一步时的状态（比如一种规则可以是：采用邻域占多数的状态。图1中即展示了这种规则下下一步此元胞自动机会怎么变化）。这种计算模型，是冯诺依曼提出的，称为冯诺依曼结构。与图灵机的计算能力是等价的。
图1 元胞自动机
（思想与图的来源：梅拉妮米歇尔《复杂》2008 [2] 。这也许只是元胞自动机的一种）
具体解释
元胞自动机的构建没有固定的数学公式，构成方式繁杂，变种很多，行为复杂。故其分类难度也较大，自元胞自动机产生以来，对于元胞自动机分类的研究就是元胞自动机的一个重要的研究课题和核心理论，在基于不同的出发点，元胞自动机可有多种分类，其中，最具影响力的当属S. Wolfram在80年代初做的基于动力学行为的元胞自动机分类，而基于维数的元胞自动机分类也是最简单和最常用的划分。除此之外，在1990年，Howard A.Gutowitz提出了基于元胞自动机行为的马尔科夫概率量测的层次化、参量化的分类体系（Gutowitz,H. A.,1990）。下面就上述的前两种分类作进一步的介绍。同时就几种特殊类型的元胞自动机进行介绍和探讨S. Wolfrarm在详细分析研究了一维元胞自动机的演化行为，并在大量的计算机实验的基础上，将所有元胞自动机的动力学行为归纳为四大类（Wolfram. S.，1986):
⑴平稳型:自任何初始状态开始，经过一定时间运行后，元胞空间趋于一个空间平稳的构形，这里空间平稳即指每一个元胞处于固定状态。不随时间变化而变化。
⑵周期型：经过一定时间运行后，元胞空间趋于一系列简单的固定结构（Stable Patterns）或周期结构（Perlodical Patterns)。由于这些结构可看作是一种滤波器（Filter），故可应用到图像处理的研究中。
⑶混沌型：自任何初始状态开始，经过一定时间运行后，元胞自动机表现出混沌的非周期行为，所生成的结构的统计特征不再变止，通常表现为分形分维特征。
⑷复杂型：出现复杂的局部结构，或者说是局部的混沌，其中有些会不断地传播。
分别描述
从另一角度，元胞自动机可视为动力系统，因而可将初始点、轨道、不动点、周期轨和终极轨等一系列概念用到元胞自动机的研究中，上述分类，又可以分别描述为：
⑴均匀状态，即点态吸引子，或称不动点；
⑵简单的周期结构，即周期性吸引子，或称周期轨；
⑶混沌的非周期性模式，即混沌吸引子；
⑷这第四类行为可以与生命系统等复杂系统中的自组织现象相比拟，但在连续系统中没有相对应的模式。但从研究元胞自动机的角度讲，最具研究价值的具有第四类行为的元胞自动机，因为这类元胞自动机被认为具有"突现计算"(Emergent Computation）功能，研究表明，可以用作广义计算机（Universal Computer）以仿真任意复杂的计算过程。另外，此类元胞自动机在发展过程中还表现出很强的不可逆（lrreversibility）特征，而且，这种元胞自动机在若干有限循环后，有可能会 "死"掉，即所有元胞的状态变为零。
应用
元胞自动机可用来研究很多一般现象。其中包括通信、信息传递（Communication）、计算（Compulation）、构造 (Construction）、材料学（Grain Growth）、复制 (Reproduction）、竞争（Competition）与进化（Evolution）等（Smith A.,1969;Perrier，J.Y.,1996）。同时。它为动力学系统理论中有关秩序 (Ordering）、紊动 (Turbulence）、混沌 (Chaos）、非对称（Symmetry-Breaking）、分形（Fractality）等系统整体行为与复杂现象的研究提供了一个有效的模型工具 (Vichhac。G，1984; Bennett，C,1985）。
元胞自动机自产生以来，被广泛地应用到社会、经济、军事和科学研究的各个领域。应用领域涉及社会学、生物学、生态学、信息科学、计算机科学、数学、物理学、材料学、化学、地理、环境、军事学等。
在社会学中
元胞自动机用于研究经济危机的形成与爆发过程、个人行为的社会性，流行现象，如服装流行色的形成等。在生物学中，元胞自动机的设计思想本身就来源于生物学自繁殖的思想，因而它在生物学上的应用更为自然而广泛。例如元胞自动机用于肿瘤细胞的增长机理和过程模拟、人类大脑的机理探索（Victor.Jonathan.D.，1990）、艾滋病病毒HIV的感染过程（Sieburg，H.B.. 1990）、自组织、自繁殖等生命现象的研究以及最新流行的克隆 (Clone）技术的研究等 (ErmentroutG。B。，1993）。
在生态学中
元胞自动机用于兔子-草，鲨鱼-小鱼等生态动态变化过程的模拟，展示出令人满意的动态效果；元胞自动机还成功地应用于蚂蚁、大雁、鱼类洄游等动物的群体行为的模拟；另外，基于元胞自动机模型的生物群落的扩散模拟也是当前的一个应用热点。在信息学中。元胞自动机用于研究信息的保存、传递、扩散的过程。另外。Deutsch(1972）、Sternberg(1980）和Rosenfeld(1979）等人还将二维元胞自动机应用到图像处理和模式识别中 (WoIfram.S.，1983）。
在计算机科学中
元胞自动机可以被看作是并行计算机而用于并行计算的研究（Wolfram.S.1983）。另外。元胞自动机还应用于计算机图形学的研究中。
在数学中，元胞自动机可用来研究数论和并行计算。例如Fischer(1965）设计的素数过滤器（Prime Number Sieves)(Wolfram,S.1983）。
在物理学中
除了格子气元胞自动机在流体力学上的成功应用。元胞自动机还应用于磁场、电场等场的模拟，以及热扩散、热传导和机械波的模拟。另外。元胞自动机还用来模拟雪花等枝晶的形成。
在化学中
元胞自动机可用来通过模拟原子、分子等各种微观粒子在化学反应中的相互作用，而研究化学反应的过程。例如李才伟 (1997）应用元胞自动机模型成功模拟了由耗散结构创始人I·Prgogine所领导的Brussel学派提出的自催化模型---Brusselator模型，又称为三分子模型。Y·BarYam等人利用元胞自动机模型构造了高分子的聚合过程模拟模型，在环境科学上，有人应用元胞自动机来模拟海上石油泄露后的油污扩散、工厂周围废水、废气的扩散等过程的模拟。
在军事科学中
元胞自动机模型可用来进行战场的军事作战模拟"提供对战争过程的aq理解（谭跃进等，1996）。
其他信息
元胞自动机作为一种动态模型，更多的是作为一种通用性建模的方法，其应用几乎涉及社会和自然科学的各个领域。

元胞数组
MATLAB中特有的数据类型
元胞数组是MATLAB中特有的一种数据类型，是数组的一种，其内部元素可以是属于不同的数据类型，概念理解上，可以认为它和c语言里面的结构体、c++里面的对象很类似。元胞数组是matlab中的特色数据类型，它不同于其它数据类型（如字符型，字符数组或者叫字符串，以及一般的算术数据和数组）。它特有的存取数据方法决定了它的特点，它有给人一种查询信息的感觉，可以逐渐追踪一直到所有的变量全部翻译成基本的数据信息。它的class函数输出就是cell（细胞之意）。

元胞数组与结构体数组
此示例比较元胞和结构体数组，并说明如何在每种类型的数组中存储数据。使用元胞和结构体数组都可以存储不同类型和大小的数据。

结构体数组
结构体数组中数据包含在可按名称访问的字段中。

例如，将患者记录存储在一个结构体数组中。

patient(1).name = 'John Doe';
patient(1).billing = 127.00;
patient(1).test = [79, 75, 73; 180, 178, 177.5; 220, 210, 205];

patient(2).name = 'Ann Lane';
patient(2).billing = 28.50;
patient(2).test = [68, 70, 68; 118, 118, 119; 172, 170, 169];

patient
patient=1×2 struct array with fields:
    name
    billing
    test

为每位患者的测试结果创建一个条形图。

numPatients = numel(patient);
for p = 1:numPatients
   figure
   bar(patient(p).test)
   title(patient(p).name)
   xlabel('Test')
   ylabel('Result')
end
Figure contains an axes object. The axes object with title John Doe contains 3 objects of type bar.

Figure contains an axes object. The axes object with title Ann Lane contains 3 objects of type bar.

元胞数组
元胞数组中数据包含在可按数值索引访问的元胞中。元胞数组的常见应用包括存储单独的文本段，以及存储电子表格中的异类数据。

例如，在一个元胞数组中存储一段时间中三个城市的温度数据。

temperature(1,:) = {'2009-12-31', [45, 49, 0]};
temperature(2,:) = {'2010-04-03', [54, 68, 21]};
temperature(3,:) = {'2010-06-20', [72, 85, 53]};
temperature(4,:) = {'2010-09-15', [63, 81, 56]};
temperature(5,:) = {'2010-12-09', [38, 54, 18]};

temperature
temperature=5×2 cell array
    {'2009-12-31'}    {[ 45 49 0]}
    {'2010-04-03'}    {[54 68 21]}
    {'2010-06-20'}    {[72 85 53]}
    {'2010-09-15'}    {[63 81 56]}
    {'2010-12-09'}    {[38 54 18]}

按日期绘制每个城市的温度。

allTemps = cell2mat(temperature(:,2));
dates = datetime(temperature(:,1));

plot(dates,allTemps)
title('Temperature Trends for Different Locations')
xlabel('Date')
ylabel('Degrees (Fahrenheit)')
Figure contains an axes object. The axes object with title Temperature Trends for Different Locations contains 3 objects of type line.

其他容器数组
结构体和元胞数组是存储异类数据的最常用容器。可以方便地使用表来存储异构的列向数据或表格数据。或者，使用映射容器或创建自己的类。

说明
元胞数组是一种包含名为元胞的索引数据容器的数据类型，其中的每个元胞都可以包含任意类型的数据。元胞数组通常包含文本列表、文本和数字的组合或者不同大小的数值数组。通过将索引括在圆括号 () 中可以引用元胞集。使用花括号 {} 进行索引来访问元胞的内容。

创建对象
当要将数据放入一个元胞数组中时，请使用元胞数组构造运算符 {} 创建该数组。

C = {1,2,3;
     'text',rand(5,10,2),{11; 22; 33}}
C=2×3 cell array
    {[   1]}    {[          2]}    {[     3]}
    {'text'}    {5x10x2 double}    {3x1 cell}

您也可以使用 {} 创建一个空的 0×0 元胞数组。

C = {}
C =

  0x0 empty cell array
要创建具有指定大小的元胞数组，请使用下面介绍的 cell 函数。

您可以使用 cell 预分配一个元胞数组，稍后再为其分配数据。cell 还可以将某些类型的 Java®、.NET 和 Python® 数据结构体转换为由等效的 MATLAB® 对象组成的元胞数组。

语法
C = cell(n)
C = cell(sz1,...,szN)
C = cell(sz)
D = cell(obj)
说明
示例
C = cell(n) 返回由空矩阵构成的 n×n 元胞数组。

示例
C = cell(sz1,...,szN) 返回由空矩阵构成的 sz1×...×szN 元胞数组，其中，sz1,...,szN 表示每个维度的大小。例如，cell(2,3) 返回一个 2×3 元胞数组。

示例
C = cell(sz) 返回由空矩阵构成的元胞数组，并由大小向量 sz 来定义数组大小 size(C)。例如，cell([2 3]) 返回一个 2×3 元胞数组。

D = cell(obj) 可将 Java 数组、.NET System.String 或 System.Object 数组或者 Python 序列转换为 MATLAB 元胞数组。

创建元胞数组
当相关的数据段具有不同的数据类型时，可将它们放在一个元胞数组中。每个元胞包含一段数据。要引用元胞数组的元素，请使用数组索引。您可以使用圆括号 () 对元胞数组进行索引，使用花括号 {} 对元胞的内容进行索引。

创建一个元胞数组，其中包含在给定日期测得的几个温度读数。将日期指定为字符向量，将温度指定为双精度数组。要将这些数据段存储在元胞数组中，请将它们放在花括号中。

C = {'2017-08-16',[56 67 78]}
C=1×2 cell array
    {'2017-08-16'}    {[56 67 78]}

将不同日期的读数添加到元胞数组中。要添加更多元胞，您可以通过赋值来扩展元胞数组，就像扩展普通数组一样。

C(2,:) = {'2017-08-17',[58 69 79]};
C(3,:) = {'2017-08-18',[60 68 81]}
C=3×2 cell array
    {'2017-08-16'}    {[56 67 78]}
    {'2017-08-17'}    {[58 69 79]}
    {'2017-08-18'}    {[60 68 81]}

对 C 的第一行进行索引。当您使用圆括号 () 进行索引时，将得到一个作为该元胞数组子集的元胞数组。

C(1,:)
ans=1×2 cell array
    {'2017-08-16'}    {[56 67 78]}

对元胞的内容进行索引。当您使用花括号 {} 进行索引时，将得到指定元胞中包含的数据段。

C{1,2}
ans = 1×3

    56    67    78

方形元胞数组
创建一个由空矩阵构成的 3×3 元胞数组。

C = cell(3)
C=3×3 cell array
    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}
    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}
    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}

三维元胞数组
创建一个由空矩阵构成的 3×4×2 元胞数组。

C = cell(3,4,2);
size(C)
ans = 1×3

     3     4     2

根据现有数组克隆大小
创建由大小与现有数组相同的空矩阵组成的元胞数组。

A = [7 9; 2 1; 8 3];
sz = size(A);
C = cell(sz)
C=3×2 cell array
    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}
    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}
    {0x0 double}    {0x0 double}

通常可以将前两行代码合并成一行：

C = cell(size(A));
提示
使用 cell 函数创建一个由空矩阵组成的元胞数组，等同于将一个空矩阵赋给新建元胞数组的最后一个索引。例如，以下两个语句是等效的：

C = cell(3,4,2);
C{3,4,2} = [];

凸包（Convex Hull）是一个计算几何（图形学）中的概念。

在一个实数向量空间V中，对于给定集合X，所有包含X的凸集的交集S被称为X的凸包。X的凸包可以用X内所有点(X1，...Xn)的凸组合来构造.

在二维欧几里得空间中，凸包可想象为一条刚好包著所有点的橡皮圈。

用不严谨的话来讲，给定二维平面上的点集，凸包就是将最外层的点连接起来构成的凸多边形，它能包含点集中所有的点。

定义
⒈对于一个集合D，D中任意有限个点的凸组合的全体称为D的凸包。
⒉对于一个集合D，所有包含D的凸集之交称为D的凸包。
可以证明，上述两种定义是等价的
概念
1 　点集Q的凸包（convex hull）是指一个最小凸多边形，满足Q中的点或者在多边形边上或者在其内。图1中由红色线段表示的多边形就是点集Q={p0,p1,...p12}的凸包。
图1 示例图
2 　一组平面上的点，求一个包含所有点的最小的凸多边形，这就是凸包问题了。这可以形象地想成这样：在地上放置一些不可移动的木桩，用一根绳子把他们尽量紧地圈起来，并且为凸边形，这就是凸包了。
数学定义：设S为欧几里得空间
的任意子集。包含S的最小凸集称为S的凸包，记作conv(S)。[1]
平面求法
常见求法
凸包最常用的凸包算法是Graham扫描法和Jarvis步进法
Graham's Scan法
这个算法是由数学大师葛立恒（Graham）发明的，他曾经是美国数学学会（AMS）主席、AT&T首席科学家以及国际杂技师协会（IJA）主席。
问题
给定平面上的二维点集，求解其凸包。
过程
⒈ 在所有点中选取y坐标最小的一点H，当作基点。如果存在多个点的y坐标都为最小值，则选取x坐标最小的一点。坐标相同的点应排除。然后按照其它各点p和基点构成的向量<H,p>；与x轴的夹角进行排序，夹角由大至小进行顺时针扫描，反之则进行逆时针扫描。实现中无需求得夹角，只需根据余弦定理求出向量夹角的余弦值即可。以图2为例，基点为H，根据夹角由小至大排序后依次为H，K，C，D，L，F，G，E，I，B，A，J。下面进行逆时针扫描。
图2 示例图
⒉ 线段<H,K>；一定在凸包上，接着加入C。假设线段<K,C>；也在凸包上，因为就H，K，C三点而言，它们的凸包就是由此三点所组成。但是接下来加入D时会发现，线段<K,D>；才会在凸包上，所以将线段<K,C>；排除，C点不可能是凸包。
⒊ 即当加入一点时，必须考虑到前面的线段是否在凸包上。从基点开始，凸包上每条相临的线段的旋转方向应该一致，并与扫描的方向相反。如果发现新加的点使得新线段与上线段的旋转方向发生变化，则可判定上一点必然不在凸包上。实现时可用向量叉积进行判断，设新加入的点为
，上一点为
，再上一点为
。顺时针扫描时，如果向量
与
的叉积为正（逆时针扫描判断是否为负），则将上一点删除。删除过程需要回溯，将之前所有叉积符号相反的点都删除，然后将新点加入凸包。
在图2中，加入K点时，由于线段<H,C>要旋转到<H,K>的角度，为顺时针旋转，所以C点不在凸包上，应该删除，保留K点。接着加入D点，由于线段<K,D>要旋转到<H,K>的角度，为逆时针旋转，故D点保留。按照上述步骤进行扫描，直到点集中所有的点都遍历完成，即得到凸包。
复杂度
这个算法可以直接在原数据上进行运算，因此空间复杂度为O⑴。但如果将凸包的结果存储到另一数组中，则可能在代码级别进行优化。由于在扫描凸包前要进行排序，因此时间复杂度至少为快速排序的O(nlgn)。后面的扫描过程复杂度为O(n)，因此整个算法的复杂度为O(nlgn)。
Jarvis步进法
对于一个有三个或以上点的点集Q，过程如下：
图3 示例图
计算点集最右边的点为凸包的顶点的起点，如图3的P3点。
Do
For i = 0 To 总顶点数
计算有向向量P3->Pi
If 其余顶点全部在有向向量P3->Pi的左侧或右侧，则Pi点为凸包的下一顶点
Pi点加入凸包列表
GoTo 1
End If
Next
Exit Do
1:
Loop
此过程执行后，点按极角自动顺时针或逆时针排序，只需要按任意两点的次序就可以了。而左侧或右侧的判断可以用前述的矢量点积性质实现。
中心法
先构造一个中心点，然后将它与各点连接起来，按斜率递增的方法，求出凸包上部；再按斜率递减的方法，求出凸包下部。
水平法
从最左边的点开始，按斜率递增的方法，求出凸包上部；再按斜率递减的方法，求出凸包下部。水平法较中心法减少了斜率无限大的可能，减少了代码的复杂度。
快包法
选择最左、最右、最上、最下的点，它们必组成一个凸四边形（或三角形）。这个四边形内的点必定不在凸包上。然后将其余的点按最接近的边分成四部分，再进行快包法(QuickHull)。

A Guide to Dependencies, Constraints and Assumptions (Part 1): Project Dependencies
Linh Tran, Wednesday 31 August 2016 | Reading time: 6 min.
Project Management

A Guide to Dependencies, Constraints and Assumptions (Part 1): Project Dependencies Explained

Dependencies, constraints and assumptions – you’ve probably heard about all of these terms before, but do you really know the difference? Let's take a closer look at these three aspects.

In this blog series, we’ll take a closer look at the three factors that are the keys to a successful and timely project delivery. Projects are a risky business because their successful implementation depends on so many internal and external factors. Planning a project is challenging, because you have to consider project dependencies, constraints and assumptions. In this first part of the series, we’ll concentrate on explaining the different types of project dependencies and their relationships to each other.
What are project dependencies?

    “Dependencies describe the relationship between two or more sequential tasks. These relationships determine in which order the project team needs to do the tasks. Thus, the project manager needs to identify the dependencies between tasks in order to draw up the project schedule.“

(Source: InLoox Project Management Glossary)

So in short, dependencies define in which order project tasks and activities should be carried out. Why is this so important? Let’s use a simple example to illustrate it: Imagine you’re building a house and start with building the roof, then you build the walls, and only then you start with the foundation. That doesn’t sound logical, does it? The same goes for projects, as every project has a logical sequence of tasks. Some of these tasks can be done simultaneously, while others depend on predecessor tasks to finish before you can start them. The difficulty of accurately determining dependencies is that they could occur between tasks of the same projects, but a task of one project could also be dependent on a task of another project. Furthermore, a task can be preceded or succeeded by multiple tasks.
Mandatory vs. discretionary dependencies

Project dependencies can be mandatory or discretionary. Mandatory dependencies are activities that must be carried out at a specific time, either because the client requires it, legal regulations, or because it would make no sense to carry them out at any other time (see the house example).

Discretionary dependencies are not defined by these requirements and are more of a recommendation. The project team can decide themselves on when they would like to finish the task or the activity, based on their experience and best practice. Discretionary allow the team much more flexibility to plan the schedule according to their needs and capacity.
Internal vs. external dependencies

Internal dependencies exist between two activities within the project, thus the project team can control the dependency completely and is not dependent on any outside sources.

External dependencies are relationships between project activities and activities outside of the project, i.e. activities over which the project team has no control over, but which still have to be considered in the project schedule.
How to plan and manage dependencies?

    Determine whether the dependency is between tasks within the project or outside of it.
    List and sort all tasks and activities and determine their dependency to each other.
    Determine the critical path, i.e. the sequence of tasks that has to be completed before the project can be finished.
    Visualize dependencies and the critical path in a network diagram such as a Gantt chart.
    Regularly review your project schedule and make adjustments when necessary.

The 4 dependency relationships
End-to-Start
Project Dependency Relationships: End to Start or Finish to Start

The most common type of dependency, the End-to-Start relationship is saying that the predecessor task must finish before the successor task can start. So if we take the home building example, this means that you will need to buy land first, before you can start building a house.
Start-to-Start
Project Dependency Relationships: Start to Start

Start-to-Start dependencies state that the predecessor task must start before successor can start. The tasks don’t have to start simultaneously, the successor task can start any time after the predecessor has started. An example would be: The moment you start cooking the rice, you can start preparing the vegetables.
End-to-End
Project Dependency Relationships: End to End or Finish to Finish

End-to-End dependencies say that the predecessor must finish before the successor can finish. The tasks don’t have to finish at the same time, the successor can finish any time after the predecessor has ended. For example, if you didn’t build your house from scratch, but ordered a prefabricated house, some tasks can only be finished after the house was “delivered” (e.g. adding the patio).
Start-to-End
Project Dependency Relationships: Start to End or Start to Finish

This scenario almost never happens, but for the sake of completeness, should also be mentioned here. The Start-to-End is saying that the successor task can’t finish before the predecessor task has started. The easiest example here is billing, you can only finish the billing process, after you have started the delivery of your product or service.

A Guide to Dependencies, Constraints and Assumptions (Part 2): Managing Constraints

Project ManagementProductivity

A Guide to Dependencies, Constraints and Assumptions (Part 2): Managing Constraints

A project is always dependent on various internal and external aspects. In the first part of this series, we defined what dependencies are. Part 2 will be all about the factors that restrict a project: The project constraints.
What are constraints?

Constraints are very similar to dependencies in that they also have an impact on the project’s delivery. However, the two concepts are not the same, as dependencies are about the order or sequence of tasks. Whereas constraints are limitations to the project, such as the limited availability of resources like time and funds. A huge part of a project manager’s job is to balance project constraints. The PMI differentiates between six competing constraints:

    Scope
    Schedule
    Budget/Costs
    Quality
    Resources
    Risks

‘Competing’ means that each constraint has an impact on one or more of the other constraints. So let’s say you’re building a house: Your cement delivery is one week late because the supplier has a shortage of manpower right now. You can’t start laying your house’s foundation until the cement arrives, so your project’s schedule is delayed for one week. This delay has a direct impact on your budget because you will have to pay the construction crew one extra week. The change in the schedule has a direct impact on the costs and also an impact on the resources.

The Magic Triangle (aka Iron Triangle or Project Triangle)
The project triangle, often called ‘magic triangle’
Why is it so important to manage constraints?

Project managers have to carefully identify, assess and manage constraints because they have a direct impact on whether or not the team can finish the project on time, within budget and within scope. Constraints are restrictions, which means that you have to take them into account when making project decisions from the very start. The clearer you define the constraints the easier will it for your team to work around them. Just like dependencies, constraints serve as a guide to help you plan your projects more accurately. Which is why they can’t be vague, you need to define them clearly and communicate it to your team. A bad practice example would be: “We have to finish the project by around the third quarter of the year.” This time limit is extremely vague, does it mean the project must be completed by the beginning of July or by the end of September? A better way to phrase it: “We have to finish the project by July 23rd and no later.” This is precise and leaves no room for interpretation, thus it helps your team put the project into perspective and focus on getting things done on time.
How to manage constraints more effectively

Managing constraints can be challenging, but it is possible to plan your project around them and not let them affect your project’s schedule, budget or scope too much. Here are a few best practice tips that help you manage constraints better:

    Make a list of all constraints that could affect your project. Documenting everything makes sure that you won’t overlook any constraints.
    Include the biggest constraints in your project charter and/or your project scope statement. This ensures that everyone on the team has access to the information.
    Communicate with important stakeholders, particularly the project sponsor and upper management. Be open about the constraints the project is facing and how important it is to not just manage risks, but all constraints.
    Constantly monitor and assess constraints. Sometimes constraints might change during the course of the project, or they might even disappear. For example, a past legal regulation might have been overturned and does not apply to your project anymore. Keep changes to a minimum though, because while they can have positive effect, changes can also have a negative impact on your project. The keyword here is ‘scope creep’.

Stay tuned for more: The next part of this series will be all about project assumptions and how they differentiate from dependencies and constraints.

A Guide to Dependencies, Constraints and Assumptions (Part 3): Project Assumptions
Linh Tran, Wednesday 28 September 2016 | Reading time: 5 min.
Project Management

A Guide to Dependencies, Constraints and Assumptions (Part 3): Making Project Assumptions

Assumptions are events that are expected to occur during a project’s life cycle, often without any proof. They are accepted as truths at the start of a project, though they can turn out to be false.

In part 1 and part 2 of this series, we’ve covered the concepts dependencies and constraints. While there’s never complete certainty in project planning, which is why we can’t emphasize the importance of change and risk management enough, there are events and issues you can anticipate with a certain degree of certainty as a result of previous experiences. Which is why project managers have to make assumptions at the start of any project.
What are project assumptions?

An assumption is something that is believed to be true. It’s an event that you can expect to happen during a project. However, that certainty isn’t supported by factual proof, it comes from experience. Just like dependencies and constraints, assumptions are events that are outside of the project manager’s and team’s control. But unlike constraints, which put restrictions on a project and can pose a danger to its successful completion, assumptions open possibilities for it and make it possible for the project to finish successfully. This is how you can differentiate assumptions from constraints and dependencies.

You need to make assumptions in a project to be able to move forward with it. As we’ve established, planning is never certain and there are many external factors you can’t control or anticipate. But you can’t just wait and delay the start of a project until you have all necessary information and certainty – because that will never happen. Making assumptions, documenting them and managing them is an important, but often overlooked part of project planning.
Managing project assumptions in 5 steps
1. Define

You will realize that you will have to make a lot of assumptions during the course of a project. There are some assumptions you definitely need to define:

    Human resource availability: All key project team members are available and have the necessary skills and knowledge to work on the project.
    Budget availability: The determined budget is accurate and covers all project expenses.
    Scheduling accuracy: The set deadlines and milestones are achievable and the project can be finished on time.
    Performance of contractors, suppliers and vendors: All necessary equipment and goods are available whenever you need them.
    Upper management support: You have the support and buy-in from the C-Level and the project sponsor, who will back you up when issues arise.

2. Assess

Make a list of all project assumptions and prioritize them. Which assumptions are almost 100% certain to occur, and which are less certain? The whole project team should be involved in this step as they are the ones who actively work on the project and can contribute their combined experiences, this will allow for more accurate assumptions. There are two factors on which you can assess an assumption:

    The probability of its occurrence
    Its possible impact on the project.

3. Document

Write the key assumptions down in the project initiation document, along with the project dependencies and constraints. This will help you keep an overview of all aspects that might restrict your projects and also help you identify all the possibilities that enable you to deliver the project on schedule and on budget.
4. Monitor

Documenting assumptions also enables you to monitor and control them better. Assumptions are often true, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t turn out to be false during the course of the project. Remember, that assumptions are not facts. You need to constantly track and monitor assumptions. At one point or another in the project’s life cycle, you will be able to prove whether an assumption was true or false. Include the regular monitoring of assumptions in your project plan, e.g. schedule dates on which you will test whether your assumption was right or not.
5. Review

As assumptions are based on experiences, it’s vital that you review them at the end of the project. Which assumptions proved to be true and had the biggest impact on the project’s outcome? Which turned out to be false and had to be dismissed? Answering these questions will help you make more accurate assumptions in future project.

What is the difference between independent and dependent requirements?
Michael Management

Overview

Imagine a scenario where a production technician wants to produce 10 bicycles. He requires two tires to produce one bicycle. In this scenario, the forecast or independent requirement, assuming a pure make-to-stock strategy, is 10 bicycles while the dependent requirements is 20 tires. Basically, a dependent requirement is based on the demand for another item while an independent requirement is not based on the demand for another item.

amortized 摊销
  Finger Tree
  In computer science, a finger tree is a purely functional data structure that can be used to efficiently implement other functional data structures. A finger tree gives amortized constant time access to the "fingers" (leaves) of the tree, which is where data is stored, and concatenation and splitting logarithmic time in the size of the smaller piece. It also stores in each internal node the result of applying some associative operation to its descendants. This "summary" data stored in the internal nodes can be used to provide the functionality of data structures other than trees.

字源演变
会意字。从亡，从石。西周金文中，“宕”有以“广”为形旁的异体（应隶定为“右”），后来这种异体没有沿用下来。“宕”所从的“石”的上部，一直到汉代的隶书中，仍保持篆文的写法，类似于“厂”。到楷书中把撇与横的交接点移到横的中间。
本义是洞屋。《说文》：“宕，过也。一日洞屋。从亡，砀省声。”林义光《文源》：“石为砀省不显。洞屋，石洞如屋者。从石、广。洞屋前后通，故引申为过。徐灏注笺：“岩，盖石室空洞之义。”由洞屋引申有通过、宽广、放纵、飘荡、拖延、拖下等意义。[4]

  语境？条件？

By definition, respect means to demonstrate “high regard” for or special attention to something or someone. However, this definition alone does not tell us what that ‘something’ is or how it is done. The requirements for respect must be considered from both a social and individual perspective.

Respect
Respect, also called esteem, is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important or held in high esteem or regard. It conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities. It is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.

cryptographic nonce

    Ben Lutkevich, Technical Writer

What is a nonce?

A nonce is a random or semi-random number that is generated for a specific use. It is related to cryptographic communication and information technology (IT). The term stands for "number used once" or "number once" and is commonly referred to as a cryptographic nonce.

Typically, a nonce is a value that varies with time to verify that specific values are not reused. A nonce can be a timestamp, a visit counter on a webpage or a special marker intended to limit or prevent the unauthorized replay or reproduction of a file.
What are other meanings of nonce?

In general usage, outside of computer science and IT, nonce has several meanings. They include the following:

    Nonce can mean "for the immediate occasion" or "for now."
    A nonce word is a neologism -- newly coined word or expression -- that is created for a single use, such as inclusion in a work of fiction. Once created, nonce words often make their way into common language. For example, Lewis Carroll coined the word "chortle" for the poem Jabberwocky, and James Joyce created the word "quark" for his novel Finnegans Wake.
    Nonce orders are an architectural term describing one-off custom designs or spinoffs of classical orders or design conventions in architecture.
    A nonce is also British slang for a pedophile.

Types of nonce values

A nonce can be categorized based on how it is generated, either randomly or sequentially. A random nonce is produced by stringing arbitrary numbers together. A sequential nonce is produced incrementally. Using the sequential nonce method guarantees that values are not repeated, cannot be replayed and do not take up unnecessary space.

Using the random nonce method safeguards against attackers that collect several keys within a system. Ideally, a nonce will have both random and sequential parts.

For example, a timestamp of 3:01 p.m. 9/17/2020 would be a sequential nonce, because it is produced incrementally. It is highly unlikely that value had occurred before or would ever occur again. It is somewhat predictable. A hacker could learn the pattern that timestamped keys are generated and guess the value of the next one.

A pseudo-random number generator can produce more unpredictable nonces. However, it would be less likely to be unique because there is a chance that the same random number could be generated more than once.
How to use a nonce

Nonce values can be used for a variety of IT applications, including the following:

    Authentication. Nonce is used by authentication protocols to ensure that old communications cannot be reprocessed.
    Hashing. Proof of work systems use nonce values to vary input to a cryptographic hash function. This helps fulfill arbitrary conditions and provide a desired difficulty.
    Initialization. An initialization vector is a nonce used for data encryption. It is used only once in any session and prevents a repetition of sequences in encrypted text. Identifying repetitions can help an attacker break a cipher.
    Identity management. Account recovery, two-factor authentication or single sign-on are identity management features that can use nonce values.
    Electronic signatures. Secret nonce values are sometimes used by e-signature tools to create, compare and verify signatures.
    Cryptocurrency. In certain cryptocurrencies, a nonce is used to create a cryptographic hash that connects to a blockchain. In Bitcoin mining, a golden nonce refers to a hash value that is lower than the target difficulty.
    Asymmetric cryptography. In specific instances of public key cryptography, such as in the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security handshake, two unique nonce values are exchanged. One value is provided by the client while the other is provided by the server. This is called asymmetric cryptography, and it protects each connection from attacks or interventions.

Cryptographic nonce example

Cryptographic nonce is used in authentication protocols to defend against replay attacks. Replay attacks are when an attacker intercepts authentication data in transit and uses it later to gain access to the protected network.

E-commerce sites typically use a nonce to assign originality to each purchase. Without this, an attacker could potentially replay the encrypted information as many times as desired and place additional orders using the same account name and purchase information.

E-commerce provider PayPal uses nonces in its encryption scheme to send sensitive payment information. This helps the company comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
diagram explaining nonce for authentication
In a digest authentication scheme, the server generates a nonce. The client responds with a hash key that combines the user's credentials with the nonce. The server then responds with a token that the client uses to log in. This approach prevents replay attacks because the credentials are not sent in plain text.
Nonce use in cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining, a peer-to-peer process to maintain the security and authenticity of the blockchain ledger. As part of the process, blockchain miners record digital currency transactions and create new Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. Miners validate the trustworthiness of transactions and add new transaction data to the global public ledger of past transactions, creating the blockchain.

Miners use sophisticated software and algorithms to solve complex problems. The first miner to solve a problem receives a new block of the cryptocurrency they are working with. Nonce is the arbitrary number that miners must come up with -- essentially guess -- to produce a number less than or equal to the target hash.

Solving for the nonce requires trial and error because it is a random string. Miners will guess the nonce, add it to the to the hash of the current block header, rehash the value and see if it is less than or equal the value of the target hash.

NB: A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism.

Edit: From Wikipedia:

  Let S be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on S one finds permutations of S and constant functions associating to each x∈S a given c∈S.

  Every permutation of S has the codomain equal to its domain and is bijective and invertible.

  A constant function on S, if S has more than 1 element, has a codomain that is a proper subset of its domain, is not bijective (and non invertible).

  The function associating to each natural integer n the floor of n/2 has its co-domain equal to its domain and is not invertible.

  Finite endofunctions are equivalent to directed pseudoforests. For sets of size n there are n**n endofunctions on the set.

  Particular bijective endofunctions are the involutions, i.e. the functions coinciding with their inverses.

---
  @danza: for example, the constant function on the integers f(n)=1, is not a homomorphism with respect to addition, since it fails to map the identity element of the domain to the identity element of the codomain.
  But that text from Wikipedia appears to be using "codomain" to refer to what I'd call the "range" of a function, so a better example might be g(n)=n+1.
  Of course one can still "find" the structure of the domain in the structure of the codomain, even though it doesn't satisfy g(n+m)=g(n)+g(m), but there are much "messier" permutations of Z if you prefer! – Steve Jessop Jul 10, 2015 at 1:39

endofunction (plural endofunctions) (mathematics) A function whose codomain is equal to its domain. Translations . function whose codomain is equal to its domain.

An endofunction (or self-mapping or other variation) is an endomorphism in the category of sets, that is a function from a set X to X itself. Ok, what new names we have now for endofunction if endomorphism were not in the category of sets for endofunction definition? we can no longer use as label the word "endofunction" because

Since you may be dealing with functions and relations unto their depths, knowing better about domain and range sets would be considerable.
Codomain of a function

The codomain of a function is known to be its set of possible outputs. In other words, codomain is a set of elements that may possibly and logically be produced by the function and the inputs that may be entered.

For instance, consider the use of function notation f: R→R, It would certainly mean that f is a function from real number to real number. In other words, it could be said that the codomain of f is a set of real numbers R (also the set of its possible inputs or domains is also supposed to be a set of real numbers RR).

Now, just because an object exists as the codomain of a function, it does not imply that it would come out as an outcome for the inputs entered for the function. Consider an example,

Suppose that we have defined a function f: R→R,

. Here, since f(x) would always be non-negative, the number -3 despite being a codomain of the function cannot come out as an outcome since there are no inputs that could actually result in a negative outcome. The set of all outputs that would be received from putting in all inputs into the function is called range. While range is a set of non-negative real numbers, codomain is a set of all considerable real numbers.

It may now be clear to you that a “codomain of a relation or a function is a set of values which include the range as explained earlier and can include additional values apart from the ones in the range.

Codomains are of importance in the following cases:

    When you are required to restrict the outputs of a considered function. For instance, by specifying a codomain as a “set of positive real numbers”, you may be instructing the ones who’re ignoring any negative values while using the function.
    It might be difficult to specify the range exactly. However, a larger set of numbers that includes a few that could possibly be the part of the range can surely be specified. For instance, a codomain could define a set of entirely positive real numbers even though; a function does not generate all positive real numbers.

Since the range is quite difficult to be specified, thinking about the codomain could help in attaining the range.

What is the difference between codomain and image?
is that codomain is (mathematics) the target space into which a function maps elements of its domain it always contains the range of the function, but can be larger than the range if the function is not surjective while image is (mathematics) the subset of a codomain comprising those elements that are images of something.

Suppose that f:X→Y is a function.
If E is a set, then f(E) (i.e. the set of all f(x) such that x is in E) is called the image of E under f.
    Why "image"? Mainly because you have to call it something, and what else would you call it? It makes some sense to call it "image", if you think of X as a shape that's turned into something else by f.
  The range of f is the specific set f(X), i.e. the image of the domain.
      So image and range don't mean exactly the same thing.
      The term "range" is natural, since f(X) is the set of all members of the codomain Y that are "reached" by the function f. f(X)={f(x)|x in X}={y in Y|there's an x in X such that f(x)=y}.
  ###
  # I disagree with this. There are two common usages of the word range. One usage of the word range is the same as the image of a function, which is the usage you describe above. The other usage is for the codomain of the function. Both conventions are fairly common.


Also, span and range don't mean the same thing, but you probably know that. The span of a subset of a vector space is the smallest vector subspace that contains the set, or equivalently, the set of all linear combinations of members of the set.
]

[
The term 'image' as in 'image of a function' originated in a slightly different usage.

The 'image of a point' under a function is the value of the function there, so if y=f(x), then y is the image of x. (We also say x is a 'preimage' of y.)

Another term that's often used is the 'image of a set under a function,' which refers to the set of all images of points in the set. For instance, the image of the iterval [-∞,-2] under the squaring operation is the interval [4,∞].

The 'image of a function' X→Y just refers to the image of X under the function. Range and image mean the same thing, and range has a more intuitive origin, like you mentioned.

Usage of 'span' is pretty much isolated to linear algebra.

 I'm very surprised by these comments. Are there really books that define "range" so that f(X) can be a proper subset of the range of f? If you all have seen it, then I guess I have to believe it, but honestly, if it had been only two of you saying it instead of three, I would have assumed that you're both really drunk. :smile:

 OK, I need to think this through to see if I can make sense of it. I will write down my thoughts. (Sorry, this will be a long post, but it will at least be useful to everyone who wants to understand the definitions of the term "function").


 The idea behind the definition of "function" is that we should be able to think of a function f:X→Y as a rule that takes each member of the set X to exactly one member of the set Y. But to properly define the term in the framework of ZFC set theory, we must specify which set f is. Since there are many sets that we can think of as representing a rule like that, there are also many ways to make the concept of "function" (that we already understand on an intuitive level) mathematically precise. These are two similar, but not equivalent, ways to make the concept mathematically precise:

 Definition 1
  A set f |<=| X*Y is said to be a function from X into Y, if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
    <==>
      [@x<-X. ?y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
      [@x<-X. @y1,y2<-Y. [(x,y1),(x,y2)<-f] -> [y1===y2]]

  X is said to be the domain of f.
  Y is said to be a codomain of f.
  f is also called the graph of f.
    So the function and its graph is the same thing.
        ----under Definition 1

 Definition 2
  A triple f=(X,Y,G) is said to be a function from X into Y, if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-G]]
  X is said to be the domain of f.
  Y is said to be the codomain of f.
  G is said to be the graph of f.

If we use definition 1, then a function has many codomains. If f is a function from X into Y and Y is a subset of Z, then Z is also a codomain of f.

If we use definition 2, each function has exactly one codomain.

Definition 1 is slightly simpler, and seems to be the more popular one in the literature. It also seems desirable to have a definition that only admits one function that (for example) "takes every real number to its square".

If we use definition 2, there are infinitely many such functions. For example, there's one with codomain {x in ℝ|x≥0}, one with codomain ℝ, one with codomain ℂ, etc.

But definition 2 at least has the advantage that it makes phrases like "f is surjective" unambiguous. If f is a function from X into Y, then it can only mean that f is surjective onto Y. But if we use definition 1, and Y is a subset of Z, it can also mean that f is surjective onto Z.

If we use one of these definitions, then it seems very strange to me to use the word "range" for the set Y. For example, the complex number -1+i would be in the range of the function defined by f(n)=n+1 for all natural numbers n. This makes me wonder if there is any English word that would be less appropriate here than "range". Maybe those 7 words that George Carlin liked to talk about.

There is however a definition that doesn't require us to mention the codomain (or even the domain) at all. The trick is to first define an ordered pair (a,b) (where a and b are arbitrary sets) by (a,b)={{a},{a,b}}.


 Definition 3
  A set f whose members are ordered pairs is said to be a function if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
    [@(x,y1)<-f. @(x,y2)<-f. [y1===y2]]
      ---same as Definition 1???
      ---   no X,Y, only f
      ---       X,Y are derived by f

If we use this definition, then it wouldn't make much sense to define the term "codomain" at all. We would define the domain X by ...
The range f(X) can be defined similarly.

I think this approach is much harder to understand (we need to know things like why ⋃(⋃f) is a set), so I wouldn't recommend it. The concept of "codomain" seems to be unnecessary, but if it makes the definitions simpler, then I don't mind using it.

Conclusion: I can see why someone might want to leave out the word "codomain", but not why anyone would want to define "range" differently. To be honest, I'm thinking that if it's really common to call the codomain "the range", then it's probably like the pronunciation "nucular" (damn you Jack Bauer) or the word "irregardless". It started with a misunderstanding, and then people started copying the mistake. Finally, so many people were doing it wrong that we started saying that it's not wrong anymore.

By the way, someone who doesn't have "codomain" in their vocabulary, and defines the range of f as the set f(X), shouldn't have any use for the term "surjective" (="onto"), because every function is surjective onto its range.

One of the reasons why I have no idea what terminology is common in English is that I first learned this from a book written in Swedish. The sets X,Y and f(X) were respectively called "definitionsmängd" (=definition set), "målmängd" (target set) and "värdemängd" (value set). I think those terms are much more intuitive than the English ones.


 I believe definitions 1 and 3 are equivalent: given a function according to definition 3, we simply let X = {x:there exists some y s.t. (x,y) in f}. Then we have sufficient information to apply definition 1, and see that they agree. (The reverse agreement is trivial.) X never needs to be specified, because that information is encoded in the graph (the set f, that is). It's only Y that is sometimes necessary to make explicit, if we want to talk about surjectivity. Really the only difference between 1/3 and 2 is that 1/3 make the codomain explicit. The 2-functions can be considered as functions from f into our universe of consideration, which are necessarily never surjective. However, the codomain is key anytime we want to consider an algebra of functions (that is, in any category), since each object has a distinct identity map. (If distinct objects had the same identity endomorphism, we would probably find some odd pathologies.)

The codomain of a function X→Y is Y, which I believe is the range in your usage. In my experience, however, range is used very inconsistently to refer to both meanings, but actually is more often synonymous with image.

By the way, I tutor a couple of students a precalculus class at my university, and one of the topics covered is "domain and range of functions" (always real-valued functions of a real variable). A function is not formally defined: it's considered to be an algebraic expression. The domain is either specified, or taken to be the "natural domain" of the expression which is the largest subset of R on which the expression is defined. Codomain is never specified, and the "range" sought is *always* the image. However, this interpretation doesn't quite disagree with either definition of "range," since we don't explicitly have a codomain

What is an abbreviation?

An abbreviation is a shortened form of a written word or phrase. Abbreviations may be used to save space and time, to avoid repetition of long words and phrases, or simply to conform to conventional usage.

The styling of abbreviations is inconsistent and arbitrary and includes many possible variations. Some abbreviations are formed by omitting all but the first few letters of a word; such abbreviations usually end in a period: Oct. for October, univ. for university, and cont. for continued. Other abbreviations are formed by omitting letters from the middle of the word and usually also end in a period: govt. for government, Dr. for Doctor, and atty. for attorney. Abbreviations for the names of states in the U.S. are two capitalized letters, e.g., AR for Arkansas, ME for Maine, and TX for Texas.

Acronyms are abbreviations formed from the initial letters of an expanded phrase and usually do not include periods: PR for public relations, CEO for chief executive officer, and BTW for by the way. Some acronyms are pronounced as words: FEMA for Federal Emergency Management Agency and NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Although some people assert that all acronyms not pronounced as words, such as EPA for Environmental Protection Agency, be referred to as initialisms, the term acronym is in fact applied to both.

What's the difference between an abbreviation and an acronym?

Some people are unsure of whether to call ASAP or appt abbreviations or acronyms. Both abbreviation and acronym are used to refer to a shortened form, but an acronym is a shortened form of a phrase and is usually made up of the initial letters of that phrase. For example, NATO comes from “North Atlantic Treaty Organization,” and ASAP comes from “as soon as possible.” Abbreviations, on the other hand, can be shortened forms of words or phrases, and need not necessarily be made up of the initial letters of either. ASAP and appt (for appointment) are both considered abbreviations, but only ASAP is an acronym. Acronyms are a type of abbreviation.

contiguous vs continuous
  As adjectives the difference between contiguous and continuous is that contiguous is connected; touching; abutting while continuous is without break, cessation, or interruption; without intervening time.
  ===
  One- contiguous -describes items that are adjacent to each other. The other, continuous, means never-ending.
  ===
  The word contiguous is derived from the Latin word contiguus, which means touching, bordering upon. Contiguous is an adjective, related words are contiguously, contiguousness, contiguity.
  Continuous describes something that is unbroken, whole, something that is not interrupted, a pattern that is not interrupted.

contiguous vs consecutive


===
"Continual" means happening again and again at short intervals as "continual reminders." Example: The loud trucks were a continual problem.

"Continuous" means uninterrupted, whether of time or space, as in "continuous misery," "continuous rain," or "continuous range of mountains." Example: The stormy weather was continuous.

"Consecutive" means occurring one after the other, as in "consecutive days of the week." Example: Are we to attend on consecutive days?

They are certainly not interchangeable.

Consider a sheet of paper. The sheet is contiguous: From any point on the paper you can arrive at any other point on the paper, without ever leaving the paper. If you tear the paper into two or three pieces, it is no longer contiguous: you can't reach a spot on piece B from piece A.

Then consider the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a series of consecutive whole numbers: there are no numbers missing in the series. If we instead have the numbers 1, 2, 5, we don't have consecutive numbers anymore because there are numbers missing in the middle of the list. Similarly, if you have the years 2010, 2012, and 2013 they are not consecutive because there's a year missing in the middle.

So, consecutive things can be lined up in a particular order with unit spacing, and there will be no gaps.

A contiguous thing can be linear, planar, spatial, or N-dimensional; as long as you can get from one point in the thing to any other point in the thing without leaving it, it is contiguous.

In the strictest sense, you could consider consecutive to be sort of "one-dimensionally contiguous", but I don't recommend thinking of it that way.

---
  The word for "connected throughout" is more properly "continuous". "Contiguous" would more properly be applied to a separate piece of paper that is in contact (touching) the first piece. – Jeff Y Dec 6, 2015 at 21:51

Difference between Modulo and Modulus

    Difficulty Level : Medium
    Last Updated : 08 Jun, 2021

In the world of Programming and Mathematics we often encounter the two terms “Modulo” and “Modulus”. In programming we use the operator “%” to perform modulo of two numbers. It basically finds the remainder when a number x is divided by another number N.  
It is denoted by : 

x mod N 
 where
x : Dividend 
N : Divisor

Some important links to find out more about concepts in Modular Arithmetic :

    Compute n! under modulo p
    Wilson’s Theorem
    How to compute mod of a big number?
    Find value of y mod (2 raised to power x)
    Modulus Operator in C
    Modulus of Negative Numbers

In this article we are going to see the difference between the two terms, modulo and modulus, used frequently in Modular Arithmetic.

Modulo :
It is basically an operator which is denoted by “mod” and, in programming, uses “%”. It is a function which returns the remainder value when a number is divided by another number.
For example –

1. 12 mod 5 // 12 modulo 5
2. 38 ≡ 14 (mod 12) // 38,14 are congruent modulo 12

Modulus :
It is simply a noun which is the value N in the expression “x mod N”. 
We abbreviate it as N is the modulus.
For example –

1. 12 mod 3 // 3 is the modulus

In the previous example, note that the congruent modulo basically means that the difference of the two numbers is an integer multiple of the modulus 12.

    The difference of 38 and 14 is 24 and 24 is double of 12.

It is important to note that these two words can’t be interchanged as it will completely change the meaning. It would be bogus to say that –

1. 12 mod 10 // error:modulo is 10
2. 38 ≡ 14 (mod 12) // error:38,14 are congruent modulus 

In terms of English, we can conclude that modulo is a preposition, as prepositions are used before a noun to show some spatial and temporal relations of the noun modulus. The relation in modular arithmetic is the remainder when two numbers are added.

译文
求学的人，其情欲文饰一天比一天增加；求道的人，其情欲文饰则一天比一天减少。减少又减少，到最后以至于“无为”的境地。如果能够做到无为，即不妄为，任何事情都可以有所作为。治理国家的人，要经常以不骚扰人民为治国之本，如果经常以繁苛之政扰害民众，那就不配治理国家了。
注释
1、为学日益：为学，是反映探求外物的知识。此处的“学”当指政教礼乐。日益：指增加人的知见智巧。
2、为道日损：为道，是通过冥想或体验的途径，领悟事物未分化状态的“道”。此处的“道”，指自然之道，无为之道。损，指情欲文饰日渐泯损。
3、无为而无不为：不妄为，就没有什么事情做不成。
4、取：治、摄化之意。
5、无事：即无扰攘之事。
6、有事：繁苛政举在骚扰民生。
引语
本章讲“为学”和“为道”的问题。他先讲“为学”，是求外在的经验知识，经验知识愈积累愈多。老子轻视外在的经验知识，认为这种知识掌握得越多，私欲妄见也就层出不穷。“为道”和“为学”就不同一。它是透过直观体悟以把握事物未分化的状态或内索自身虚静的心境，它不断地除去私欲妄见，使人日渐返朴归真，最终可以达到“无为”的境地。这一章所讲的“为学”是反映“政教礼乐之学”，老子认为它足以产生机智巧变。只有“清静无为”，没有私欲妄见的人才可以治理国家。因而，老子希望人们走“为道”的路子。
评析
任继愈先生认为：“老子承认求学问，天天积累知识，越积累，知识越丰富。至于要认识宇宙变化的总规律或是认识宇宙的最后的根源，就不能靠积累知识，而要靠‘玄览’、‘静观’。他注重理性思维这一点是对的，指出认识总规律和认识个别的东西的方法应有所不同，也是对的。老子的错误在于把理性思维绝对化使他倒向了唯心主义，甚至陷于排斥感性知识的错误。”（《老子的研究》，《老子哲学讨论集》第23页）张松如先生说：“‘为学者日益，为道者日损’，并不是老子的一种什么神秘的、蒙昧的反理性的主张，而是一定发展中的历史现象在观念形态上的客观反映。”“本章正是从认识论和方法论上，概括了对‘礼’所作的探源与批判，而且是具有相当深刻性的。”“在这剖析过程中，由于受着不得突破的阶级的和历史的局限，在所推导的结论中，还带有一定程度的复古主义色彩，显示了骸骨迷恋的情绪，而不曾投射出向前看的目光。然而，这并不能掩盖它有关‘学’与‘道’，有关‘日益’和‘日损’的辩证思维的光辉。“（《老子校读》第281页）“无为而无不为”是老子提出来的极富智慧的命题。事实上，在中国古代，主张“无为”的学者不止老子一人，例如孔子就曾说过“无为而治者，其舜也与，夫何为哉，恭已正南面而已。”这句话的意思是，自己不做什么事情而使得天下太平的人，大概只有舜了，他做了什么呢？他只是庄重端坐在他的王位上罢了。老子把“无为”的思想发挥到极高的程度，从哲学高度来论证“无为”的社会意义。“无为”表面看来，似乎是一种后退的手段，但真正的目的，则在于避开前进中所存在的矛盾和问题，从而占据主动，以达到“无不为”的最终目的。
作者简介
老子，又称老聃、李耳，是我国古代伟大的哲学家和思想家、道家学派创始人。其被唐皇武后封为太上老君，世界文化名人，世界百位历史名人之一，存世有《道德经》（又称《老子》），其作品的精华是朴素的辨证法，主张无为而治，其学说对中国哲学发展具有深刻影响。在道教中老子被尊为道祖。
老子像
老聃（dān）（约前571～前471），字伯阳，谥号聃。又称李耳（古时“老”和“李”同音；“聃”和“耳”同义）。楚国苦县厉乡曲仁里(此地本是封于西周的陈国，今河南鹿邑，安徽涡阳存有争议）人。我国最伟大的哲学家和思 想家之一，被道教尊为教祖，世界文化名人。
作品出处
《为学日益，为道日损》出自老子的《道德经》第四十八章。
《道德经》，又称《道德真经》、《老子》、《五千言》、《老子五千文》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子（即李耳，河南鹿邑人）所撰写，是道家哲学思想的重要来源。道德经分上下两篇，原文上篇《德经》、下篇《道经》，不分章，后改为《道经》37章在前，第38章之后为《德经》，并分为81章。是中国历史上首部完整的哲学著作。
《道德经》到了公元前206年-公元200年，被奉为道教经典，所以有学者认为《道德经》被分为八十一章有明显的道教的九九归一的思想，在内容的分割上未免牵强。但道德经前三十七章讲道，后四十四章言德，简单说来，道是体，德是用，二者不能等同。至清代魏源首次破此惯例而分《道德经》为六十八章，相对保持了每章的完整性。

天道：上天的意思的体现。人道：人事。迩：近。[1] 鲁昭公十八年（前524年，郑定公六年），包括郑国在内的多个诸侯国发生火灾。据《左传》记载，此前一年（前525年，郑定公五年），郑国人裨灶就曾经预言火灾的发生，并要求用瓘、斝、玉瓒祭神，子产不答应。[6] [4] [5] 这次火灾后，裨灶又说：“不采纳我的意见，郑国还要发生火灾。”郑国人请求采纳他的意见，子产不同意。子太叔说：“宝物是用来保护百姓的。如果有了火灾，国家差不多会灭亡。可以挽救灭亡，您爱惜它干什么？”子产说：“天道悠远，人道切近，两不相关。如何由天道而知人道？灶哪里懂得天道？这个人的话多了，难道不会偶尔也说中的？”于是就不给。后来也没有再发生火灾。[2]
