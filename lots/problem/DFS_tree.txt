when implimenting DFS, I want to pass the edge_index to every son node.
(graph is formed of an adjacency list, an edge list, 
 so the edge_index is the location of that edge in the edge list)
assume that calc the edge_index is O(log(degree(v)), v is one end of the edge.

if I calc the edge_index to every son node in the parent node, 
(that is using the parent node for calculation),
then the cost is sum O(degree(v)*log degree(v)) for any v = O(n*log n)


but if I calc the edge_index in side the son node itself,
(that is using son node for calculation)
then the cost is sum O(log degree(v)) for any v = O(n)


just the choose of node in the edge can make such a difference!!!!
