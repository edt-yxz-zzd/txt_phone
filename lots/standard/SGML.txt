SGML is an ISO standard: "ISO 8879:1986 Information processing ¡ª Text and office systems ¡ª Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)", of which there are three versions:

Original SGML, which was accepted in October 1986, followed by a minor Technical Corrigendum.
SGML (ENR), in 1996, resulted from a Technical Corrigendum to add extended naming rules allowing arbitrary-language and -script markup.
SGML (ENR+WWW or WebSGML), in 1998, resulted from a Technical Corrigendum to better support XML and WWW requirements.
