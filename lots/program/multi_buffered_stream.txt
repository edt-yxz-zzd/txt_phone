fptr = file_open(fname, mod, chunk_size, cache_number, cache_strategy)
readonly_fptr[n] = fptr.copy()
writeonly_fptr[k] = fptr.copy()
rw_fptr[m] = fptr.copy()

each fptr owns a window(= {beg,cur,end})
a window binds to a member chunk, but a chunk may be binded by many windows
all chunks of the same file is of the same size, and is in a chunk tree
that tree is used to guarantee the map from piece of file to memory is unique
a dirty tree indicates which chunks are changed for flushing
each fptr has at most cache_number chunks.
