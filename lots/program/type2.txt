StructType - C struct/union
    value of any object that represented by DataStructure
    e.g. when using uint32 as wchar_t, there are lots of values are not unicode


SubsetType - C++ class
    value passed some tests
    DynamicSubsetType : e.g. prime integer
    
    certificate


AbstractType - C++ concept+traits
    operations and contacts - concept
        e.g. in Haskell, add :: Integral a -> Integral b -> Integral c
            add a b = fromInteger $ toInteger a + toInteger b
        when we use uint32 as a uint_mod_(2**32), it will never raise except "div0"
        when we use uint32 as a integer, it will raise if over/underflow
        
    what actually types are using as input/output? - traits
        e.g. in Haskell, Integral a operates with type 'a'
        ecosystem that are all together be a abstract unit, not only a single type
        
    what if two ecosystems want to talk to each other?
        using some standard types
        e.g. protocal/utf8/Integer



    NOTE:
        C++ and Haskell are both static type
        what if using DynamicSubsetType?
            e.g. 
                factor(n) -> [(prime_base, exp)]
                we may decl a prime set:
                    s = {} all prime;
                    s.add(i) # will raise if i not imply prime
                    s.update(p for p,_ in factor(n)) # success!!
                    if known p is prime
                    if k == p then s.add(k) # success
