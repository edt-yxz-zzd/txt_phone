Difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1436703/difference-between-str-and-repr-in-python

1)The default implementation is useless
    __repr__ goal is to be unambiguous
        representation of python object usually 
        eval will convert it back to that object
    __str__ goal is to be readable 
        if __repr__ is defined, and __str__ is not, 
        the object will behave as though __str__=__repr__.
        but not vice versa.
2) Container's __str__ uses contained objects' __repr__
