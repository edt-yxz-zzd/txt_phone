1.13.5 The Human Visual System
    Our perception of brightness is not linear, however: If you print thin black stripes on a piece of white paper so that only 20%of the white paper remains visible, it will reflect only 20%of the light that falls on it. But if you place that piece of paper next to a blank piece of the same type of white paper and view both from a distance great enough that the stripes are not visible, the printed paper will appear about half as bright as the unprinted paper. Roughly speaking, for an eye adapted to a given level of light, reducing the incoming light intensity by 80% will make the light seem half as bright.

2.3.2 Immediate-Mode versus Retained-Mode Platforms
the word ¡°look¡± refers to the graphical design/appearance (size, shape, font, coloring, drop shadow, etc.). The word ¡°feel¡± pertains to the controls¡¯ dynamic behaviors, typically in response to user interaction, which can be subdivided into built-in automated feedback behaviors and semantic/application behaviors.
