precedence graph T^2 : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0
invariant: the two threads always have tokens located on adjacent nodes, with the direction of the edge indicating their relative order. 

[dominate]
    Let G be a precedence graph, and A and B subgraphs of G(possibly single nodes). We say that A dominates B in G if every node of A has edges directed to every node of B. 
[<<]
    Let graph multiplication be the following noncommutative composition operator for graphs (denoted G<<H):
    Replace every node v of G by a copy of H (denoted H[v]), and let H[v] dominate H[u] in G<<H if v dominates u in G.


Define the graph L^k(T^(k-1)) inductively to be:
1. L^0 is a single node.
2. L^1 is T^2 the three-node graph defined earlier.
3. For k > 1, L^k = L^1 << L^(k-1)

let T^k = L^(k-1)
n-thread ==>> L^(n-1); [Mod3] of len (n-1)
The precedence graph T^n or is the basis for an n-thread bounded sequential timestamping system. We can ¡°address¡± any node in the T^n graph with (n-1) digits, using ternary notation.
