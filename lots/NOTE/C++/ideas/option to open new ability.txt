if we export compile to xml, what options/attrs should be?
    more options, more abilities.
user depend on the specified options to ensure his power.
    neednot to care other options!! no exception!
option of a perticular attr should be:
    * choices from closed world
        i.e. Bool always be True|False, never others
        no default // since default is well globally known
    * choices from open world
        may or may not has default
    * choices from some future languish version
        must has default // since for backward compatibility

bad example:
    static/extern
    T, T const

    extern is default, static to close opened world
    mutable is default, const to close writable

good example:
    T&
        you can view me
    T&&
        you can view me
        and you can move me
