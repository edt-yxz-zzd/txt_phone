3.21 Using Precompiled Headers

1. compile
    g++ -x <header>
    # xxx.hpp ==>> xxx.hpp.gch
    use make to keep up-to-date
2. search
    always <header>.gch before <header> under same folder
    at diff folder?
        # use -I to ensure that directory is searched before
        g++ -I<pch_folder> ...
    // ? maybe diff option (-DNDEBUG) makes diff .gch
    // so even there is a .gch, it may not be used
    // see "3. test"
3. test
    g++ -x xxx.hpp
    mv xxx.hpp xxx.hpp._ && echo #error>xxx.hpp

4. global
    good for projects not designed with precompiled header files in mind

    others.hpp
        include all other project headers included by ".cpp"

    stds.hpp
        include others.hpp
        include most std headers used/may used
    precompile stds.hpp
        // stable!

    all.hpp
        include stds.hpp
        include all stable headers of this project
        include most extra std headers used/may used
        include most extra others headers used/may used
    precompile all.hpp
        // not that stable

    g++ -x all.hpp
    g++ -include all.hpp xxx.cpp yyy.cpp ...
        // ? xxx.cpp = '#include "all.hpp"\n' + xxx.cpp

5. many
    precompile the same header file for different languages, targets, or compiler options

    g++ -x xxx.hpp options... -o xxx.hpp.gch/[options...].gch
