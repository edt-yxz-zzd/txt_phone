    Appendix C Overload Resolution

The implicit conversion provided through the converting constructor is not considered during template argument deduction.
ensure that all overloaded versions of a function are declared before the function is called.

Before C++17, type T also had to be copyable to be able to pass in arguments, but since C++17 you can pass temporaries (rvalues, see Appendix B) even if neither a copy nor a move constructor is valid.
You can define default arguments for template parameters. These may refer to previous template parameters and be followed by parameters not having default arguments.
