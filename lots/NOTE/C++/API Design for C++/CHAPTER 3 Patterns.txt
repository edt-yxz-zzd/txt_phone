CHAPTER 3 Patterns
TIP
    Use the pimpl idiom to keep implementation details out of your public header files.
    NOTE: copy/assign, const method(since we have mutable, why not same_constness_ptr??), ...
TIP
    A Singleton is a more elegant way to maintain global state, but you should always question whether you need global state.
TIP
    Creating a thread safe Singleton in C++is hard. Consider initializing it with a static constructor or an API initialization function.
TIP
    Dependency injection makes it easier to test code that uses Singletons.
    // NOT to construct required object by the using functions, but by the caller; that is pass the object directly, not args to construct it.
TIP
    There are several alternatives to the Singleton pattern, including dependency injection, the Monostate pattern, and use of a session context
