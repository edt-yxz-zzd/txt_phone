API Design for C++

The progression of chapters in this book roughly follows the standard evolution of an API, 
    from initial design through implementation,
    versioning, 
    documentation, 
    and testing.

    backward compatibility requirement
        Due to the backward compatibility requirement, it is critical to have a change control process in place.
    
    good documentation
        header files does not define the behavior of the API, such as acceptable input values or error conditions.
    
    automated testing
        If you are making major changes to the implementation of your API, you can be more confident that you will not break your clients programs if you have a thorough suite of regression tests to verify that the desired API behavior has not changed.
