What is a Surrogate Key?
    An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key. These kind of key are unique because they are created when you don't have any natural primary key. They do not lend any meaning to the data in the table. Surrogate key is usually an integer.

Surrogate keys are allowed when
    * No property has the parameter of the primary key.
    * In the table when the primary key is too big or complicated.
