-- same column but diff types
A single column in SQLite may contain different values of different storage classes.


--------------------
sqlite> select typeof(3.14), typeof('3.14'), typeof(314), typeof(x'3142'), typeof(NULL);
typeof(3.14) typeof('3.14') typeof(314) typeof(x'3142') typeof(NULL)
------------ -------------- ----------- --------------- ------------
real text integer blob null



----------------------------
* integer
    Integer values are whole numbers (positive and negative).
    They can vary in size: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes.
    The maximum integer range (8 bytes) is {-9223372036854775808,-1,0,1, 9223372036854775807}.
    SQLite automatically handles the integer sizes based on the numeric value.
    -0x8000_0000_0000_0000
    +0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffff
* real
    Real values are real numbers with decimal values. SQLite uses 8-byte floats to store real numbers.
* text
    Text is character data. SQLite supports various character encodings, which include UTF-8 and UTF-16 (big and little endian). The maximum string value in SQLite is adjustable at compile time and at runtime and defaults to 1,000,000,000 bytes.
* blob
    Binary large object (BLOB) data is any kind of data. The maximum size for BLOBs in SQLite is adjustable at compile time and at runtime and defaults to 1,000,000,000 bytes.
* NULL
    NULL represents missing information. SQLite has full support for NULL handling.



-------------------
SQLite infers a valueâ€™s type from its representation. The following inference rules are used to do this:
    -- "xxx" ==>> text
    -- 'xxx' ==>> text
    *  A value specified as a literal in SQL statements is assigned class text if it is enclosed by single or double quotes.
    -- 123 ==>> integer
    *  A value is assigned class integer if the literal is specified as an unquoted number with no decimal point or exponent.
    -- 12.3 ==>> real
    -- 123E1 ==>> real
    *  A value is assigned class real if the literal is an unquoted number with a decimal point or an exponent.
    -- NULL ==>> NULL
    *  A value is assigned class NULL if its value is NULL.
    -- x'23ABCDEF' ==>> blob
    *  A value is assigned class blob if it is of the format x'ABCD', where ABCDare hexadecimal numbers. The xprefix and values can be either uppercase or lowercase.

The typeof() SQL function returns the storage class of a value based on its representation. Using this function, the following SQL illustrates type inference in action:
