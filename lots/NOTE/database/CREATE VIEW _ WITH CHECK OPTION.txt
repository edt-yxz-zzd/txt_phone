#create view xxx as select * from table where status = 1 with check option
create view xxx as select * from table where status = 1
update table set status = 2 where id = 3
    #update using the table (ok):
update xxx set status = 2 where id = 3
    #update using the view (not ok):
    #and if you would do this, it would make the row disappear

CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a < 2
    WITH CHECK OPTION;
CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE a > 0
    WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;
        ^^^^^^^
CREATE VIEW v3 AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE a > 0
    WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;
         ^^^^^^^

ERROR 1369 (HY000): CHECK OPTION failed 'test.v3'

Here the v2 and v3 views are defined in terms of another view, v1.
v2 has a LOCAL check option, so inserts are tested only against the v2 check.
v3 has a CASCADED check option, so inserts are tested not only against its own check, but against those of underlying views.
