Preconditions and Postconditions
Cohesion and Coupling
    The public interface of a class is cohesive if all of its features are related to the concept that the class represents.
    A class depends on another class if it uses objects of that class.
    It is a good practice to minimize the coupling (i.e., dependency) between classes.

variadic
    degree of an operator
        Arithmetic subtraction provides an example of noncommutative binary operation, 
        whereas a change of sign (as in -x) is an example of unary operation. 
        If the same sign ‘-’ is used to denote both operations, the operator becomes 
            'variadic' with degree one or two.

quadrilateral = quadrangle = tetragon
    In Euclidean plane geometry, a quadrilateral is a polygon with four edges (or sides) and four vertices or corners.

universe
    a universe is a collection that contains all the entities one wishes to consider in a given situation. It is closely related to the concept of a domain of discourse in philosophy.
    universe and complement.
    In type theory, a universe is a type whose elements are types.

## [page297]Formal_Languages_and_Compilation(2ed)::5.2 Translation Relation and Function
## e.g. f : D->2^I, f^-1 : I->2^D # powerset
total           every source string has one or more images
                # any x in D, f(x) != {}
partial         one or more source strings do not have any image
                # exists x in D s.t. f(x) == {}
single-valued   no string has two distinct images
                # any x in D, |f(x)| <= 1 
multi-valued    one or more source strings have more than one image
                # exists x in D s.t. |f(x)| > 1
injective       distinct source strings have distinct images or, differently stated, any target string corresponds to at most one source string; only in this case the inverse translation is single valued
                # [x!=y] ==>> [f(x) ^ f(y) == {}]
                # any i in I, |f^-1(i)| <= 1
                # [single-valued f^-1]
surjective      the image of the translation coincides with the range, i.e., every string over the target alphabet is the image of at least one source string; only in this case the inverse translation is total
                # any i in I, exists x in D s.t. i in f(x)
                # any i in I, f^-1(i) != {}
                # [total f^-1]
bijective(or simply one-to-one) 
                the correspondence between the source and target strings is both injective and surjective, i.e., it is one-to-one; only in this case the inverse translation is bijective as well
                # any x in D, f(x) = {i}
                # any i in I, f^-1(i) = {x}
                # [transform f, f^-1]
                    # where transform = total & single-valued
