Caret Notation	Hex Code	Abbreviation	Name	Description
^@	00	NULL	Null	Used to perform media-fill and allow gaps. Also used for padding after any code and to mark end of string, notably in programming language C/C++.
^A	01	STX	Start of Header	Used as first character of head of data broadcast/message. It is usually used as field separator in Apache Hadoop.
^B	02	SOT	Start of Text	Heads text and used to mark end of heading.
^C	03	ETX	End of Text	Marks end of text. In keyboard input, it is frequently used as Break character to interrupt process.
  Notably seen in Unix based command lines, nano editor, etc. as (^C) to break command.
^D	04	EOT	End of Transmission	Used to mark end of transmission of one or more texts(may involve header, broadcast text, and post-text).
  It is also used to mark end-of-file(EOF) on terminal in UNIX based OS.
^E	05	ENQ	Enquiry	Requests for reply from remote terminal, response may include transmitter identification and/or transmitter status.
^F	06	ACK	Acknowledge	This character is sent by receiver as approving response to sender. (Response to ENQ)
^G	07	BEL	Bell	A control character to call for attention. It may control alarm or attention devices. Initially, it was used to play bell sound on terminal.
^H	08	BS	BackSpace	Shifts cursor one character position behind. While in input mode this might delete character to left of cursor. When in output mode, character once written could not be deleted(Primitively).
^I	09	HT	Horizontal Tabulation	Shifts cursor to next determined character position on the same line.
^J	0A	LF	Line Feed	Shifts cursor to equivalent character position of next line. It is used to mark end-of-line(EOF) in UNIX. In DOS/Windows LF is used after CR(Carriage Return) to mark end-of-line.
^K	0B	VT	Vertical Tabulation	Shifts cursor at next line.
^L	0C	FF	Form Feed	It commands printer to discard current page and to proceed to print at the next one.
    More so, it also acts as whitespace in various programming languages,
^M	0D	CR	Carriage Return	Primitively used to move cursor to very first column while staying on the same line/row. In DOS, /Windows, it is used before LF to mark end-of-line(EOF). Enter/Return key corresponds to this character.
^N	0E	SO	Shift Out	Switches to substitute character set.
^O	0F	SI	Shift In	Reverts to general character set after Shift Out.
^P	10	DLE	Data Link Escape	It is used particularly to deliver additional data transmission control functions. Only graphic characters and transmission control characters can be used in DLE sequences.
^Q	11	DC1	Device Control 1 (XON)	A device control character, basically dedicated to turning on or starting essential device. It might also be used to restore any device to basic mode of operation.
^R	12	DC2	Device Control 2	A device control character which is basically dedicated to turning on or starting essential device. It might also be used to set any device to special mode of operation
^S	13	DC3	Device Control 3 (XOFF)	A device control character which is basically dedicated to turning off or stopping an essential device. Also acts as secondary step stop(e.g: wait, pause, stand-by or halt)
^T	14	DC4	Device Control 4	A device control character, basically dedicated to turning off al device. It might also be used for any device control purpose not granted by other DCs.
^U	15	NAK	Negative acknowledge	A control character sent by receiver as negative acknowledgment/response to transmitter. NAK also indicates that an error was identified in last received block.
^V	16	SYN	Synchronous Idle	Used by synchronous transmission network to provide signal from which synchronous rectification may be achieved between data terminal equipment
^W	17	ETB	End of Transmission Block	marks end of transmission segment of data (where data is divided into such segments for transmission)
^X	18	CAN	Cancel	Indicates that data preceding it is in error. Hence, data is to be ignored.
^Y	19	EM	End of Medium	A control character that can be used to find physical end of medium or end of wanted portion of data.
^Z	1A	SUB	Substitute	Used as an alternative for character that has been detected to be invalid or in error. On Unix, ^Z is keyboard signal to suspend process. In DOS/Windows, it is used to mark end of file, in cmd terminal, text files and many scripts.
^[	1B	ESC	Escape	Esc key corresponds to this control character on almost every operating system. Used in many interface to escape from screen, menu, or process.,
^\	1C	FS	File Separator	Used to separate data logically, its specific purpose has to be defined for each application. When used in hierarchical order, it delimits data item called file.
^]	1D	GS	Group Separator	Used to separate data logically; its specific purpose has to be defined for each application. When used in hierarchical order, it delimits data item called group.
^^	1E	RS	Record Separator	Used to separate data logically; its specific purpose has to be defined for each application. When used in hierarchical order, it delimits data item called record.
^_	1F	US	Unit Separator	Used to separate data logically; its specific purpose has to be defined for each application. When used in hierarchical order, it delimits data item called unit.
	20	SP	Space	Space is graphic character. Shifts cursor to move by one character position.
^?	7F	DEL	Delete	The delete control character is last character in ASCII repertoire. It was designed to erase incorrect characters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The shifted cursor keys, the help key, and the undo key are only
available on a few terminals.  On the Amiga, shifted function key 10 produces
a code (CSI) that is also used by key sequences.  It will be recognized only
after typing another key.

Note: There are two codes for the delete key.  127 is the decimal ASCII value
for the delete key, which is always recognized.  Some delete keys send another
value, in which case this value is obtained from the termcap entry "kD".  Both
values have the same effect.  Also see |:fixdel|.

Note: The keypad keys are used in the same way as the corresponding "normal"
keys.  For example, <kHome> has the same effect as <Home>.  If a keypad key
sends the same raw key code as its non-keypad equivalent, it will be
recognized as the non-keypad code.  For example, when <kHome> sends the same
code as <Home>, when pressing <kHome> Vim will think <Home> was pressed.
Mapping <kHome> will not work then.

								*<>*
Examples are often given in the <> notation.  Sometimes this is just to make
clear what you need to type, but often it can be typed literally, e.g., with
the ":map" command.  The rules are:
 1.  Any printable characters are typed directly, except backslash and '<'
 2.  A backslash is represented with "\\", double backslash, or "<Bslash>".
 3.  A real '<' is represented with "\<" or "<lt>".  When there is no
     confusion possible, a '<' can be used directly.
 4.  "<key>" means the special key typed.  This is the notation explained in
     the table above.  A few examples:
	   <Esc>		Escape key
	   <C-G>		CTRL-G
	   <Up>			cursor up key
	   <C-LeftMouse>	Control- left mouse click
	   <S-F11>		Shifted function key 11
	   <M-a>		Meta- a  ('a' with bit 8 set)
	   <M-A>		Meta- A  ('A' with bit 8 set)
	   <t_kd>		"kd" termcap entry (cursor down key)
    Although you can specify <M-{char}> with {char} being a multi-byte
    character, Vim may not be able to know what byte sequence that is and then
    it won't work.

If you want to use the full <> notation in Vim, you have to make sure the '<'
flag is excluded from 'cpoptions' (when 'compatible' is not set, it already is
by default). >
	:set cpo-=<
The <> notation uses <lt> to escape the special meaning of key names.  Using a
backslash also works, but only when 'cpoptions' does not include the 'B' flag.

Examples for mapping CTRL-H to the six characters "<Home>": >
	:imap <C-H> \<Home>
	:imap <C-H> <lt>Home>
The first one only works when the 'B' flag is not in 'cpoptions'.  The second
one always works.
To get a literal "<lt>" in a mapping: >
	:map <C-L> <lt>lt>

For mapping, abbreviation and menu commands you can then copy-paste the
examples and use them directly.  Or type them literally, including the '<' and
'>' characters.  This does NOT work for other commands, like ":set" and
":autocmd"!
