topology

In mathematics, topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing.

non-orientable surface with boundary
    Mobius strip

orientable surface with no boundary
    g-holed torus # "g" - genus
        g==0: sphere
        g==1: torus

non-orientable surface with no boundary
    2-manifold with g holes and c cross-caps (c > 0)
        # two-dimensional manifold
        sphere with c cross-caps (c > 0)
            # g == 0
            c==1: real projective plane
            c==2: Klein bottle

homeomorphism vs homotopy equivalence
    #equivalence classes of the English (i.e., Latin) alphabet (sans-serif)
    homeomorphism
        {A,R} {B} {C,G,I,J,L,M,N,S,U,V,W,Z}, {D,O} {E,F,T,Y} {H,K}, {P,Q} {X}
    homotopy equivalence
        {A,R,D,O,P,Q} {B}, {C,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z}


homeomorphism =[def]=
    If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto
        , and if the inverse of the function is also continuous
        , then the function is called a homeomorphism
            and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range.

manifold =[def]=
    A manifold is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point.
        More precisely, each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n.
    1-manifold
        Lines and circles, but not figure eights, are one-dimensional manifolds.
    2-manifold
        Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces.
