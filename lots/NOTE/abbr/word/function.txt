cryptographic nonce

    Ben Lutkevich, Technical Writer

What is a nonce?

A nonce is a random or semi-random number that is generated for a specific use. It is related to cryptographic communication and information technology (IT). The term stands for "number used once" or "number once" and is commonly referred to as a cryptographic nonce.

Typically, a nonce is a value that varies with time to verify that specific values are not reused. A nonce can be a timestamp, a visit counter on a webpage or a special marker intended to limit or prevent the unauthorized replay or reproduction of a file.
What are other meanings of nonce?

In general usage, outside of computer science and IT, nonce has several meanings. They include the following:

    Nonce can mean "for the immediate occasion" or "for now."
    A nonce word is a neologism -- newly coined word or expression -- that is created for a single use, such as inclusion in a work of fiction. Once created, nonce words often make their way into common language. For example, Lewis Carroll coined the word "chortle" for the poem Jabberwocky, and James Joyce created the word "quark" for his novel Finnegans Wake.
    Nonce orders are an architectural term describing one-off custom designs or spinoffs of classical orders or design conventions in architecture.
    A nonce is also British slang for a pedophile.

Types of nonce values

A nonce can be categorized based on how it is generated, either randomly or sequentially. A random nonce is produced by stringing arbitrary numbers together. A sequential nonce is produced incrementally. Using the sequential nonce method guarantees that values are not repeated, cannot be replayed and do not take up unnecessary space.

Using the random nonce method safeguards against attackers that collect several keys within a system. Ideally, a nonce will have both random and sequential parts.

For example, a timestamp of 3:01 p.m. 9/17/2020 would be a sequential nonce, because it is produced incrementally. It is highly unlikely that value had occurred before or would ever occur again. It is somewhat predictable. A hacker could learn the pattern that timestamped keys are generated and guess the value of the next one.

A pseudo-random number generator can produce more unpredictable nonces. However, it would be less likely to be unique because there is a chance that the same random number could be generated more than once.
How to use a nonce

Nonce values can be used for a variety of IT applications, including the following:

    Authentication. Nonce is used by authentication protocols to ensure that old communications cannot be reprocessed.
    Hashing. Proof of work systems use nonce values to vary input to a cryptographic hash function. This helps fulfill arbitrary conditions and provide a desired difficulty.
    Initialization. An initialization vector is a nonce used for data encryption. It is used only once in any session and prevents a repetition of sequences in encrypted text. Identifying repetitions can help an attacker break a cipher.
    Identity management. Account recovery, two-factor authentication or single sign-on are identity management features that can use nonce values.
    Electronic signatures. Secret nonce values are sometimes used by e-signature tools to create, compare and verify signatures.
    Cryptocurrency. In certain cryptocurrencies, a nonce is used to create a cryptographic hash that connects to a blockchain. In Bitcoin mining, a golden nonce refers to a hash value that is lower than the target difficulty.
    Asymmetric cryptography. In specific instances of public key cryptography, such as in the Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security handshake, two unique nonce values are exchanged. One value is provided by the client while the other is provided by the server. This is called asymmetric cryptography, and it protects each connection from attacks or interventions.

Cryptographic nonce example

Cryptographic nonce is used in authentication protocols to defend against replay attacks. Replay attacks are when an attacker intercepts authentication data in transit and uses it later to gain access to the protected network.

E-commerce sites typically use a nonce to assign originality to each purchase. Without this, an attacker could potentially replay the encrypted information as many times as desired and place additional orders using the same account name and purchase information.

E-commerce provider PayPal uses nonces in its encryption scheme to send sensitive payment information. This helps the company comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
diagram explaining nonce for authentication
In a digest authentication scheme, the server generates a nonce. The client responds with a hash key that combines the user's credentials with the nonce. The server then responds with a token that the client uses to log in. This approach prevents replay attacks because the credentials are not sent in plain text.
Nonce use in cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining, a peer-to-peer process to maintain the security and authenticity of the blockchain ledger. As part of the process, blockchain miners record digital currency transactions and create new Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. Miners validate the trustworthiness of transactions and add new transaction data to the global public ledger of past transactions, creating the blockchain.

Miners use sophisticated software and algorithms to solve complex problems. The first miner to solve a problem receives a new block of the cryptocurrency they are working with. Nonce is the arbitrary number that miners must come up with -- essentially guess -- to produce a number less than or equal to the target hash.

Solving for the nonce requires trial and error because it is a random string. Miners will guess the nonce, add it to the to the hash of the current block header, rehash the value and see if it is less than or equal the value of the target hash.

Whilst an endomorphism is a morphism or homomorphism from a mathematical object to itself, the technical term for a function that has a domain equal to it's co-domain is called an endofunction.

NB: A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism.

Edit: From Wikipedia:

  Let S be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on S one finds permutations of S and constant functions associating to each x∈S a given c∈S.

  Every permutation of S has the codomain equal to its domain and is bijective and invertible.

  A constant function on S, if S has more than 1 element, has a codomain that is a proper subset of its domain, is not bijective (and non invertible).

  The function associating to each natural integer n the floor of n/2 has its co-domain equal to its domain and is not invertible.

  Finite endofunctions are equivalent to directed pseudoforests. For sets of size n there are n**n endofunctions on the set.

  Particular bijective endofunctions are the involutions, i.e. the functions coinciding with their inverses.

---
  @danza: for example, the constant function on the integers f(n)=1, is not a homomorphism with respect to addition, since it fails to map the identity element of the domain to the identity element of the codomain.
  But that text from Wikipedia appears to be using "codomain" to refer to what I'd call the "range" of a function, so a better example might be g(n)=n+1.
  Of course one can still "find" the structure of the domain in the structure of the codomain, even though it doesn't satisfy g(n+m)=g(n)+g(m), but there are much "messier" permutations of Z if you prefer! – Steve Jessop Jul 10, 2015 at 1:39

Codomain of a function

Codomain

Since you may be dealing with functions and relations unto their depths, knowing better about domain and range sets would be considerable.
Codomain of a function

The codomain of a function is known to be its set of possible outputs. In other words, codomain is a set of elements that may possibly and logically be produced by the function and the inputs that may be entered.

For instance, consider the use of function notation f: R→R, It would certainly mean that f is a function from real number to real number. In other words, it could be said that the codomain of f is a set of real numbers R (also the set of its possible inputs or domains is also supposed to be a set of real numbers RR).

Now, just because an object exists as the codomain of a function, it does not imply that it would come out as an outcome for the inputs entered for the function. Consider an example,

Suppose that we have defined a function f: R→R,

. Here, since f(x) would always be non-negative, the number -3 despite being a codomain of the function cannot come out as an outcome since there are no inputs that could actually result in a negative outcome. The set of all outputs that would be received from putting in all inputs into the function is called range. While range is a set of non-negative real numbers, codomain is a set of all considerable real numbers.

It may now be clear to you that a “codomain of a relation or a function is a set of values which include the range as explained earlier and can include additional values apart from the ones in the range.

Codomains are of importance in the following cases:

    When you are required to restrict the outputs of a considered function. For instance, by specifying a codomain as a “set of positive real numbers”, you may be instructing the ones who’re ignoring any negative values while using the function.
    It might be difficult to specify the range exactly. However, a larger set of numbers that includes a few that could possibly be the part of the range can surely be specified. For instance, a codomain could define a set of entirely positive real numbers even though; a function does not generate all positive real numbers.

Since the range is quite difficult to be specified, thinking about the codomain could help in attaining the range.

What is the difference between codomain and image?
is that codomain is (mathematics) the target space into which a function maps elements of its domain it always contains the range of the function, but can be larger than the range if the function is not surjective while image is (mathematics) the subset of a codomain comprising those elements that are images of something.

Suppose that f:X→Y is a function.
If E is a set, then f(E) (i.e. the set of all f(x) such that x is in E) is called the image of E under f.
    Why "image"? Mainly because you have to call it something, and what else would you call it? It makes some sense to call it "image", if you think of X as a shape that's turned into something else by f.
  The range of f is the specific set f(X), i.e. the image of the domain.
      So image and range don't mean exactly the same thing.
      The term "range" is natural, since f(X) is the set of all members of the codomain Y that are "reached" by the function f. f(X)={f(x)|x in X}={y in Y|there's an x in X such that f(x)=y}.
  ###
  # I disagree with this. There are two common usages of the word range. One usage of the word range is the same as the image of a function, which is the usage you describe above. The other usage is for the codomain of the function. Both conventions are fairly common.


Also, span and range don't mean the same thing, but you probably know that. The span of a subset of a vector space is the smallest vector subspace that contains the set, or equivalently, the set of all linear combinations of members of the set.
]

[
The term 'image' as in 'image of a function' originated in a slightly different usage.

The 'image of a point' under a function is the value of the function there, so if y=f(x), then y is the image of x. (We also say x is a 'preimage' of y.)

Another term that's often used is the 'image of a set under a function,' which refers to the set of all images of points in the set. For instance, the image of the iterval [-∞,-2] under the squaring operation is the interval [4,∞].

The 'image of a function' X→Y just refers to the image of X under the function. Range and image mean the same thing, and range has a more intuitive origin, like you mentioned.

Usage of 'span' is pretty much isolated to linear algebra.

 I'm very surprised by these comments. Are there really books that define "range" so that f(X) can be a proper subset of the range of f? If you all have seen it, then I guess I have to believe it, but honestly, if it had been only two of you saying it instead of three, I would have assumed that you're both really drunk. :smile:

 OK, I need to think this through to see if I can make sense of it. I will write down my thoughts. (Sorry, this will be a long post, but it will at least be useful to everyone who wants to understand the definitions of the term "function").


 The idea behind the definition of "function" is that we should be able to think of a function f:X→Y as a rule that takes each member of the set X to exactly one member of the set Y. But to properly define the term in the framework of ZFC set theory, we must specify which set f is. Since there are many sets that we can think of as representing a rule like that, there are also many ways to make the concept of "function" (that we already understand on an intuitive level) mathematically precise. These are two similar, but not equivalent, ways to make the concept mathematically precise:

 Definition 1
  A set f |<=| X*Y is said to be a function from X into Y, if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
    <==>
      [@x<-X. ?y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
      [@x<-X. @y1,y2<-Y. [(x,y1),(x,y2)<-f] -> [y1===y2]]

  X is said to be the domain of f.
  Y is said to be a codomain of f.
  f is also called the graph of f.
    So the function and its graph is the same thing.
        ----under Definition 1

 Definition 2
  A triple f=(X,Y,G) is said to be a function from X into Y, if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-G]]
  X is said to be the domain of f.
  Y is said to be the codomain of f.
  G is said to be the graph of f.

If we use definition 1, then a function has many codomains. If f is a function from X into Y and Y is a subset of Z, then Z is also a codomain of f.

If we use definition 2, each function has exactly one codomain.

Definition 1 is slightly simpler, and seems to be the more popular one in the literature. It also seems desirable to have a definition that only admits one function that (for example) "takes every real number to its square".

If we use definition 2, there are infinitely many such functions. For example, there's one with codomain {x in ℝ|x≥0}, one with codomain ℝ, one with codomain ℂ, etc.

But definition 2 at least has the advantage that it makes phrases like "f is surjective" unambiguous. If f is a function from X into Y, then it can only mean that f is surjective onto Y. But if we use definition 1, and Y is a subset of Z, it can also mean that f is surjective onto Z.

If we use one of these definitions, then it seems very strange to me to use the word "range" for the set Y. For example, the complex number -1+i would be in the range of the function defined by f(n)=n+1 for all natural numbers n. This makes me wonder if there is any English word that would be less appropriate here than "range". Maybe those 7 words that George Carlin liked to talk about.

There is however a definition that doesn't require us to mention the codomain (or even the domain) at all. The trick is to first define an ordered pair (a,b) (where a and b are arbitrary sets) by (a,b)={{a},{a,b}}.


 Definition 3
  A set f whose members are ordered pairs is said to be a function if
    [@x<-X. ?1 y<-Y. [(x,y)<-f]]
    [@(x,y1)<-f. @(x,y2)<-f. [y1===y2]]
      ---same as Definition 1???
      ---   no X,Y, only f
      ---       X,Y are derived by f

If we use this definition, then it wouldn't make much sense to define the term "codomain" at all. We would define the domain X by ...
The range f(X) can be defined similarly.

I think this approach is much harder to understand (we need to know things like why ⋃(⋃f) is a set), so I wouldn't recommend it. The concept of "codomain" seems to be unnecessary, but if it makes the definitions simpler, then I don't mind using it.

Conclusion: I can see why someone might want to leave out the word "codomain", but not why anyone would want to define "range" differently. To be honest, I'm thinking that if it's really common to call the codomain "the range", then it's probably like the pronunciation "nucular" (damn you Jack Bauer) or the word "irregardless". It started with a misunderstanding, and then people started copying the mistake. Finally, so many people were doing it wrong that we started saying that it's not wrong anymore.

By the way, someone who doesn't have "codomain" in their vocabulary, and defines the range of f as the set f(X), shouldn't have any use for the term "surjective" (="onto"), because every function is surjective onto its range.

One of the reasons why I have no idea what terminology is common in English is that I first learned this from a book written in Swedish. The sets X,Y and f(X) were respectively called "definitionsmängd" (=definition set), "målmängd" (target set) and "värdemängd" (value set). I think those terms are much more intuitive than the English ones.


 I believe definitions 1 and 3 are equivalent: given a function according to definition 3, we simply let X = {x:there exists some y s.t. (x,y) in f}. Then we have sufficient information to apply definition 1, and see that they agree. (The reverse agreement is trivial.) X never needs to be specified, because that information is encoded in the graph (the set f, that is). It's only Y that is sometimes necessary to make explicit, if we want to talk about surjectivity. Really the only difference between 1/3 and 2 is that 1/3 make the codomain explicit. The 2-functions can be considered as functions from f into our universe of consideration, which are necessarily never surjective. However, the codomain is key anytime we want to consider an algebra of functions (that is, in any category), since each object has a distinct identity map. (If distinct objects had the same identity endomorphism, we would probably find some odd pathologies.)

The codomain of a function X→Y is Y, which I believe is the range in your usage. In my experience, however, range is used very inconsistently to refer to both meanings, but actually is more often synonymous with image.

By the way, I tutor a couple of students a precalculus class at my university, and one of the topics covered is "domain and range of functions" (always real-valued functions of a real variable). A function is not formally defined: it's considered to be an algebraic expression. The domain is either specified, or taken to be the "natural domain" of the expression which is the largest subset of R on which the expression is defined. Codomain is never specified, and the "range" sought is *always* the image. However, this interpretation doesn't quite disagree with either definition of "range," since we don't explicitly have a codomain
