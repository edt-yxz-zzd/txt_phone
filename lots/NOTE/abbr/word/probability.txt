probability theory
probable adj.

sample space
mutual exclusivity
    mutually exclusive events
    disjoint
    A /\ B = {}
        In logic and probability theory, two propositions (or events) are mutually exclusive or disjoint if they cannot both be true (occur).
collective exclusivity
    collectively exhaustive events
    jointly
    A \/ B = sample space
        In probability theory and logic, a set of events is jointly or collectively exhaustive if at least one of the events must occur.
