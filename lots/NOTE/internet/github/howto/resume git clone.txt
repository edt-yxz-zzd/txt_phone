resume "git clone"
question:
    e.g. >>> git clone http://git.chise.org/git/chise/ids.git
    but fail.
    how to resume?
answer:
    cannot!
try workaround:
    step1:
        git clone --depth=1     # download recent history only
    step2:
        * git fetch --depth=<N> # increase N
        * git fetch --unshallow # download all remaining revisions
result:
    fatal: dumb http transport does not support shallow capabilities

shallow clone

    Mostly a synonym to shallow repository but the phrase makes it more explicit that it was created by running git clone --depth=... command.
shallow repository

    A shallow repository has an incomplete history some of whose commits have parents cauterized away (in other words, Git is told to pretend that these commits do not have the parents, even though they are recorded in the commit object). This is sometimes useful when you are interested only in the recent history of a project even though the real history recorded in the upstream is much larger. A shallow repository is created by giving the --depth option to git-clone[1], and its history can be later deepened with git-fetch[1].
