2.2.3
    Definition: Suppose that ≤ is a partial order on a set S and s and t are elements of S . An element j ∈ S is said to be a join (or least upper bound ) of s and t if
        1. s ≤ j and t ≤ j , and
        2. for any element k ∈ S with s ≤ k and t ≤ k, we have j ≤ k.
    Similarly, an element m ∈ S is said to be a meet (or greatest lower bound) of s and t if
        1. m ≤ s and m ≤ t , and
        2. for any element n ∈ S with n ≤ s and n ≤ t , we have n ≤ m. 
