2.2.2
    Definition: A reflexive and transitive relation R on a set S is called a preorder on S. (When we speak of “a preordered set S ,” we always have in mind some particular preorder R on S.) Preorders are usually written using symbols like ≤ or v. We write s < t (“s is strictly less than t ”) to mean s ≤ t ∧ s ≠ t .
    A preorder (on a set S) that is also antisymmetric is called a partial order on S. A partial order ≤ is called a total order if it also has the property that, for each s and t in S, either s ≤ t or t ≤ s . 
