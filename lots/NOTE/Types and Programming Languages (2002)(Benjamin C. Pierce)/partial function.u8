2.1.9
    Definition: A partial function R from S to T is said to be defined on an argument s ∈ S if s ∈ dom(R), and undefined otherwise. We write f(x) ↑, or f(x) =↑, to mean “f is undefined on x,” and f(x)↓” to mean “f is defined on x.”
    In some of the implementation chapters, we will also need to define functions that may fail on some inputs (see, e.g., Figure 22-2). It is important to distinguish failure (which is a legitimate, observable result) from divergence; a function that may fail can be either partial (i.e., it may also diverge) or total (it must always return a result or explicitly fail)—indeed, we will often be interested in proving totality. We write f(x) = fail when f returns a failure result on the input x.
    Formally, a function from S to T that may also fail is actually a function from S to T ∪ {fail}, where we assume that fail does not belong to T . 
