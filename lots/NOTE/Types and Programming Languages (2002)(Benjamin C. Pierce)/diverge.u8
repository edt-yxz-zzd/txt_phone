[normal form]
    a term that cannot take a step under the evaluation relation is called a normal form.

[diverge]
    Terms with no normal form are said to diverge.

    some terms cannot be evaluated to a normal form.
    omega = (\x. x x) (\x. x x);
        contains just one redex,
        and reducing this redex yields exactly omega again!
