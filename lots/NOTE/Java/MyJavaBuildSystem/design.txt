target task:
    1. compile a module
        //auto compile all dependencies.
        <buildsystem> -c -cp <paths> xxx.yyy.MyClass
    2. extract modules to jar file
        //auto pack all dependencies and resources.
        <buildsystem> -a -cp <paths> xxx.yyy.MyClass

buildsystem:
    1. module description
        0. How to comment?
        1. Does it has main()?
        2. Which modules does it depend on?
            // maybe recursively depend
            // only those we want to put into jar
        3. Which resources does it need?
            // only those we want to put into jar
            // some are optional???
        4. Which unexported classes/non-public top-level classes in this module/JavaFile?
            version1->version2

    2. extract informations if given classpaths
    3. compile if outdate
    4. pack to jar

actual buildsystem:
    1. module description
        for each xxx/yyy/MyClass.java:
            we create xxx/yyy/MyClass.depends
        0. How to comment?
            # comment
        1. Does it has main()?
            first line: "-main" or "+main"
        2. Which modules does it depend on?
            // maybe recursively depend
            // only those we want to put into jar

            modules:
                xxx.yyy.XCls
                xxx.Y
        3. Which resources does it need?
            // only those we want to put into jar
            // some are optional???
            resources:
                # absolute
                /xxx/yyy/image.png
                # relative
                test.txt
        4. Which unexported classes/non-public top-level classes in this module/JavaFile?
            // need not package
            // nonpublic_toplevel_classes:
            toplevels:
                UnexportedClass
                Yafaf

    2. extract informations if given classpaths
    3. compile if outdate
    4. pack to jar

================ version1->version2
    see:
        "NOTE/Java/howto/non-public top-level class[multiple top level classes in a single file].txt"
    conclusion:
        make_executable_jarfile cannot handle UnexportedClass
        we should add UnexportedClass nane into DependsFile
