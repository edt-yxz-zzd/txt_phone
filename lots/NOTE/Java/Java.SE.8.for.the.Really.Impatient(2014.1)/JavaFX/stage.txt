stage
    (a top-level window, the surface of an applet,or the full screen)
    stage contains scenes # error!!!!
    
    see below: stage <-> scene (1 to 1 at any time)

scene
    scene graph = (scene, {node tree})
    scene = {node tree}
    no repeats : A node may occur at most once anywhere in the scene graph.
    no cycles

    if nodes attach to a scene,
        should modify nodes on the JavaFX Application Thread, not other thread
        

node
    node contains nodes
    node = leaf | branch
    if node has no children than it is a leaf
        i.e. leaf node = <? extends Node and ? not extends Parent>
     nonleaf/branch node = <? extends Parent>

Coordinate System
    the x axis increases to the right and the y axis increases downwards
    local coordinate space
        Rectangle provides x, y, width, height variables
        Circle provides centerX, centerY, and radius.
    device pixel level
        upper left pixel on the Stage = a unit square = (0, 0) with 1*1 = (0,0)->(1,1)
        (0.5, 0.5)
            point to the center of the upper left pixel on the Stage
        rectangle at (0, 0) with dimensions of 10 by 10
            span from the upper left corner of the upper left pixel on the Stage 
            to the lower right corner of the 10th pixel on the 10th scanline
            pixel center of the last pixel inside that rectangle would be at the coordinates (9.5, 9.5)

        device coordinates(the pixel grid) ~ transformed coordinates, not the local coordinates
    
    translation
        rectangle(x=1, y=2, w=3, h=4) with origin (?, ?)
            shift (+3, +5) ==>> modify origin not rectangle!
    transform is perform on coordinate space not on nodes!!!!!!
        transform on every nodes <==> untransformed local coordinates
    
    
    boundsInLocal
        Each Node has a read-only boundsInLocal variable which specifies the bounding rectangle of the Node in untransformed local coordinates.
        untransformed local coordinates
    boundsInParent
        Each Node also has a read-only boundsInParent variable which specifies the bounding rectangle of the Node after all transformations have been applied
        parent's coordinate system
    layoutBounds
        resizable classes ==>> (0, 0) width*height

from doc:
    public final ReadOnlyObjectProperty<Scene> sceneProperty
        The Scene to be rendered on this Stage. 
        There can only be one Scene on the Stage at a time, 
        and a Scene can only be on one Stage at a time. 


Region has its layout bounds, which are specified to be (0, 0, width, height)
    padding(i.e. insets) + (content area) == layout bounds
