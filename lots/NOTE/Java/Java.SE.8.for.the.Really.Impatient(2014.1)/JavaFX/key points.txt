? JavaFX properties emit change and invalidation events.
? When you bind a property to another, it is updated when the other one changes.
? JavaFX uses layout panes that work similar to layout managers in Swing.
? You can specify layout with the FXML markup language.
? You can use CSS to change the visual appearance of your application.
? It is easy to implement animations and special effects.
