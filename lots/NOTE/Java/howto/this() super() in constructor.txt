super() in constructor
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15206890/super-in-constructor

If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error. Object does have such a constructor, so if Object is the only superclass, there is no problem.

class B{
    public B(int i){}
}
class C extends B{
    public C(int i){
        super(i);
    }
    public C(){
        this(0);
    }
}
