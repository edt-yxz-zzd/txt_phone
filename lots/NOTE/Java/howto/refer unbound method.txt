refer to:
    ClassName::staticMethod
    ClassName::instanceMethod # unbound method
called:
    ClassName.staticMethod(...)
    ClassName.instanceMethod(self, ...)

Situations for three different ways of method reference
(args) -> ClassName.staticMethod(args)
    === ClassName::staticMethod
    or import static pkg...ClassName.staticMethod;
        then use "staticMethod" directly

(arg0, rest) -> arg0.instanceMethod(rest)
    === ClassName::instanceMethod (arg0 is of type ClassName)

(args) -> expr.instanceMethod(args)
    === expr::instanceMethod
