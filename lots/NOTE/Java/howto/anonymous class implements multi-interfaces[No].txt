anonymous class implements multi-interfaces[No]

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8163821/implement-two-interfaces-in-an-anonymous-class
An anonymous inner class can extend one class or implement one interface. Unlike non-anonymous classes (inner or otherwise), an anonymous inner class cannot do both. In other words, it cannot both extend a class and implement an interface, nor can it implement more than one interface.


since
    new ClassName() {
        ...
    };
