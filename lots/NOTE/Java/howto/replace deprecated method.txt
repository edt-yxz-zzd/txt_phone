--------- API
Let's read the Java API for Window#show():
@Deprecated
public void show()
    Deprecated. As of JDK version 1.5, replaced by setVisible(boolean).

    Makes the Window visible. If the Window and/or its owner are not yet displayable, both are made displayable. The Window will be validated prior to being made visible. If the Window is already visible, this will bring the Window to the front.

--------- ans
So you should use Window#setVisible(boolean) - for show() use setVisible(true).

In some environments just replacing show() with setVisible(true) changes the behavior of the application. This happens, when you wrote a subclass of Window that overrides show() (same for hide()).

So in your code example setVisible(true) does exactly the same as show(). But in general, just be certain, that no one overrides show() which wouldn't be executed anymore when using setVisible(true). In such a case, you have to change the overriden methods, too.
