Callable usage:
    Callable<V> f = new Callable(){
            V call() throws Exception
            {
                ...
            }
        };

The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread.
A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception.


public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}

public interface Callable<V> {
    V call() throws Exception;
}
