java.lang.System.identityHashCode
    Returns the same hash code for the given object as would be returned by the default method hashCode(), whether or not the given object's class overrides hashCode(). The hash code for the null reference is zero.

System.identityHashCode
    Object::hashCode() {return System.identityHashCode(this);}

    but doese
        Object::hashCode(obj) === System.identityHashCode(obj)
        do it refer to the actual most-derived subclass's hashCode???


The Javadoc of Object says about hashCode():
    As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects.
