Java has four levels of controlling access to fields, methods, and classes: 
    ? public access
    ? private access
    ? protected access (see Advanced Topic 10.3)
    ? package access (the default, when no access modifier is given)
        A field or method that is not declared as public, private, or protected can be accessed by all classes in the same package, which is usually not desirable.
        package is an open entity.
            i.e. we can add a new base_directory into CLASSPATH and create same package.
                 then classes under the new package can access to older one.
