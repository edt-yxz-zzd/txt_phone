The method is free to do anything if a precondition is not fulfilled.
1. A method can check for the violation and throw an exception.
2. A method can skip the check and work under the assumption that the preconditions are fulfilled. 
    If they aren't, then any data corruption (such as a negative balance) 
    or other failures are the caller's fault.

3. assertion mechanism
    If, for some reason, the assertion fails, 
        and assertion checking is enabled, 
    then the program terminates with an AssertionError.

    assert ...;

    By default, assertion checking is disabled when you execute a program. 
    To execute a program with assertion checking turned on, use this command:
    java -enableassertions MyProg
    java -ea MyProg
