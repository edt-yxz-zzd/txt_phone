There are three ways to initialize a static field:
1. Do nothing. 
    The static field is then initialized with 0(for numbers), false(for booleanvalues), or null(for objects).
2. Use an explicit initializer, such as
    public class BankAccount
    {
        . . .
        private static int lastAssignedNumber = 1000;
    }
    The initialization is executed once when the class is loaded.
3. Use a static initialization block (see Advanced Topic 8.3).




ADVANCEDTOPIC8.3:  Alternative Forms of Field Initialization
instance fields are initialized with a default value (0, false, or null, depending on their type).
  or:
    public class Coin
    {
        . . .
        private double value = 1;
        private String name = "Dollar";
    }

initialization blocks inside the class definition. 
    All statements in that block are executed whenever an object is being constructed.

    public class Coin
    {
        . . .
        {
            value = 1;
            name = "Dollar";
        }
        static
        {
            lastAssignedNumber = 1000;
        }
        
        private double value;
        private String name;
        private static int lastAssignedNumber;
    }
