According to Pillow 4.0x, the Image.resize function only works on a single image/frame.

To achieve what you want, I believe you have to first extract every frame from the .gif file, resize each frame one at a time and then reassemble them up again.

To do the first step, there appears to be some detail that needs to be attended to. E.g. whether each gif frame uses a local palette or a global palette is applied over all frames, and whether gif replace each image using a full or partial frame. BigglesZX has developed a script to address these issues while extracting every frame from a gif file so leverage on that.



It is using the thumbnail method of Pillow rather than the resize method as I found the resize method did not work.

It is not perfect so feel free to fork and improve it. Here are a few unresolved issues:

    * While the GIF displays just fine when hosted by imgur, there is a speed issue when I open it from my computer where the entire GIF only take 1.5 seconds.
    * Likewise, while imgur seems to make up for the speed problem, the GIF wouldn't display correctly when I tried to upload it to stack.imgur. Only the first frame was displayed.
