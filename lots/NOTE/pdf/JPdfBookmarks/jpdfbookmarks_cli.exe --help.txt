In the bookmarks.txt file each line is a bookmark and the hierarchy is made by
tab characters (not spaces),in the format <Title of bookmark/target
page[,FitType,TopOffset,LeftOffset] like the following example:
Chapter 1/23
[TAB]Para 1.1/25,FitWidth,96
[TAB][TAB]Para 1.1.1/26,FitHeight,43
Chapter 2/30,TopLeft,120,42
[TAB]Para 2.1/32,FitPage.
It is also possible to use an extended format to specify the text style, the
color and the open or close state of the bookmark, like the following example:
Para 1.1/25,Red,bold,italic,open,FitWidth,96 or
Para 1.1/25,Green,noBold,noItalic,closed,FitWidth,96
