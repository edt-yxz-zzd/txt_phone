always download .tex instead of .ps !!

which program?
    # https://www.texdev.net/2011/11/19/tex-on-windows-miktex-or-tex-live/
    * TeX_Live  - install everything
    * miktex    - install extra packages 'on the fly'

which command?
    # use "where ps2pdf" to see which bin folders
    # use "dir (where ps2pdf) | grep pdf" to see which .exe relative to pdf
    * pdflatex xxx.tex
        -> xxx.pdf
        better than ps2pdf
    * ps2pdf xxx.ps
        -> xxx.pdf
        bad format!
