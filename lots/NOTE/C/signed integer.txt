C2011_n1570::
6.2.6 Representations of types
6.2.6.2 Integer types
1 For unsigned integer types other than unsigned char, 
    the bits of the object representation shall be divided into two groups: 
        value bits and padding bits (there need not be any of the latter). 
    If there are N value bits, 
        each bit shall represent a different power of 2 between 1 and 2**(N-1), 
        so that objects of that type shall be capable of representing values 
            from 0 to 2**N-1 using a pure binary representation; 
        this shall be known as the value representation. 
    The values of any padding bits are unspecified.


2 For signed integer types, 
    the bits of the object representation shall be divided into three groups: 
        value bits, padding bits, and the sign bit. 
            There need not be any padding bits;
            signed chars hall not have any padding bits. 
            There shall be exactly one sign bit.
        Each bit that is a value bit shall have the same value 
            as the same bit in the object representation of the corresponding unsigned type 
            (if there are M value bits in the signed type and N in the unsigned type, then M¡ÜN). 
        If the sign bit is zero, it shall not affect the resulting value. 
        If the sign bit is one, the value shall be modified in one of the following ways:
            ¡ª the corresponding value with sign bit 0 is negated (sign and magnitude);
            ¡ª the sign bit has the value -2**M(two's complement);
            ¡ª the sign bit has the value -(2**M-1) (ones' complement).
            Which of these applies is implementation-defined, 
                as is whether the value with sign bit 1 and all value bits zero (for the first two), 
                    or with sign bit and all value bits 1 (for ones' complement), 
                is a trap representation or a normal value. 
              In the case of sign and magnitude and ones' complement, 
                if this representation is a normal value it is called a negative zero.
