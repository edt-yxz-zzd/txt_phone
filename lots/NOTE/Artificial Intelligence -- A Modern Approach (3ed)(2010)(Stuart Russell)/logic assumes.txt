The primary difference between propositional and first-order logic lies in the ontological commitment made by each language—that is, what it assumes about the nature of reality.
Mathematically, this commitment is expressed through the nature of the formal models with respect to which the truth of sentences is defined.
    For example, propositional logic assumes that there are facts that either hold or do not hold in the world. Each fact can be in one of two states: true or false, and each model assigns true or false to each proposition symbol (see Section 7.4.2).
    First-order logic assumes more; namely, that the world consists of objects with certain relations among them that do or do not hold. The formal models are correspondingly more complicated than those for propositional logic.
    Special-purpose logics make still further ontological commitments; for example,temporal logic assumes that facts hold at particular times and that those times (which may be points or intervals) are ordered.
    Thus, special-purpose logics give certain kinds of objects (and the axioms about them) “first class” status within the logic, rather than simply defining them within the knowledge base.
    Higher-order logic views the relations and functions referred to by first-order logic as objects in themselves. This allows one to make assertions about all relations—for example, one could wish to define what it means for a relation to be transitive. Unlike most special-purpose logics, higher-order logic is strictly more expressive than first-order logic, in the sense that some sentences of higher-order logic cannot be expressed by any finite number of first-order logic sentences.
