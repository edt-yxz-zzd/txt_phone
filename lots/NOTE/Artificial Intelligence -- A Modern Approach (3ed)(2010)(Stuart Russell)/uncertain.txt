computational, rather than informational, limitations
    One might well wonder about the phrase "chances of winning". After all, chess is not a game of chance: we know the current state with certainty, and no dice are involved. But if the search must be cut off at nonterminal states, then the algorithm will necessarily be uncertain about the final outcomes of those states. This type of uncertainty is induced by computational, rather than informational, limitations. Given the limited amount of computation that the evaluation function is allowed to do for a given state, the best it can do is make a guess about the final outcome.
