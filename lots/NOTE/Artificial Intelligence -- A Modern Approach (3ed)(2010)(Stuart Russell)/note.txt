    first-order definite clauses
        Datalog is a language that is restricted to first-order definite clauses with no function symbols.
        Generalized Modus Ponens is complete for definite clauses, although the entailment problem is semidecidable.For Datalog knowledge bases consisting of function-free definite clauses, entailment is decidable.
        forward inference
            matching a definite clause against a set of facts is NP-hard.
