Exercise 15.1 asks you to show that the first solution—increasing the order—can always be reformulated as an increase in the set of state variables, keeping the order fixed.

Notice that adding state variables might improve the system’s predictive power but also increases the prediction requirements: we now have to predict the new variables as well.
Thus, we are looking for a “self-sufficient” set of variables, which really means that we have to understand the “physics” of the process being modeled.
The requirement for accurate modeling of the process is obviously lessened if we can add new sensors (e.g., measurements of temperature and pressure) that provide information directly about the new state variables.
