Unsupervised clusteringis the problem of discerning multiple categories in a collection of

objects. The problem is unsupervised because the category labels are not given. For example,
suppose we record the spectra of a hundred thousand stars; are there differenttypes of stars
revealed by the spectra, and, if so, how many types and what are their characteristics? We
are all familiar with terms such as “red giant” and “white dwarf,” but the stars do not carry
these labels on their hats—astronomers had to perform unsupervised clustering to identify
these categories. Other examples include the identification of species, genera, orders, and
so on in the Linnæan taxonomy and the creation of natural kinds for ordinary objects (see
Chapter 12).
