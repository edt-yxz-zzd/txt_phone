stationary distribution ==>> mixing time
    predict future
    doom to failure

It is interesting to consider what happens as we try to predict further and further into the future. As Exercise 15.2(b) shows, the predicted distribution for rain converges to a fixed point <0.5,0.5>, after which it remains constant for all time.
This is the stationary distribution of the Markov process defined by the transition model. (See also page 537.) A great deal is known about the properties of such distributions and about the mixing time -- roughly, the time taken to reach the fixed point.
In practical terms, this dooms to failure any attempt to predict the actual state for a number of steps that is more than a small fraction of the mixing time, unless the stationary distribution itself is strongly peaked in a small area of the state space. The more uncertainty there is in the transition model, the shorter will be the mixing time and the more the future is obscured.
