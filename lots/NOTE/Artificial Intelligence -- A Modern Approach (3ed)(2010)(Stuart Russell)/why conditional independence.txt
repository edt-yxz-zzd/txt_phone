why conditional independence?
[page 499] Section 13.6. The Wumpus World Revisited

In this way, the original large table is decomposed into three smaller tables. The original table has seven independent numbers (2^3=8 entries in the table, but they must sum to 1, so 7 are independent).
The smaller tables contain five independent numbers (for a conditional probability distributions such as P(T|C) there are two rows of two numbers, and each row sums to 1, so that's two independent numbers; for a prior distribution like P(C) there is only one independent number).
Going from seven to five might not seem like a major triumph, but the point is that, for n symptoms that are all conditionally independent given Cavity, the size of the representation grows as O(n) instead of O(2^n).
That means that conditional independence assertions can allow probabilistic systems to scale up; moreover, they are much more commonly available than absolute independence assertions. Conceptually,Cavity separates Toothache and Catch because it is a direct cause of both of them.
The decomposition of large probabilistic domains into weakly connected subsets through conditional independence is one of the most important developments in the recent history of AI.
