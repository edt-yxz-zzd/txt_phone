It is also possible for ILP algorithms tocreatenew predicates in order to facilitate the
expression of explanatory hypotheses. Given the example data shown earlier, it is entirely
reasonable for the ILP program to propose an additional predicate, which we would call
“Parent,” in order to simplify the definitions of the target predicates. Algorithms that can
generate new predicates are calledconstructive inductionalgorithms. Clearly, constructive
CONSTRUCTIVE
INDUCTION
induction is a necessary part of the picture of cumulative learning. It has been one of the
hardest problems in machine learning, but some ILP techniques provide effective mechanisms
for achieving it.
