Probability theorydescribes what an agent should believe on the basis of evidence,
utility theorydescribes what an agent wants, anddecision theoryputs the two together
to describe what an agent should do.

Decision networksprovide a simple formalism for expressing and solving decision
problems. They are a natural extension of Bayesian networks, containing decision and
utility nodes in addition to chance nodes.
â€¢Sometimes, solving a problem involves finding more information before making a de-cision. Thevalue of informationis defined as the expected improvement in utility
compared with making a decision without the information.
