So what is missing?
One defect of our DDN-based algorithm is its reliance on forward search through state space,
rather than using the hierarchical and other advanced planning techniques described in Chap-ter 11. There have been attempts to extend these techniques into the probabilistic domain, but
so far they have proved to be inefficient. A second, related problem is the basically proposi-tional nature of the DDN language. We would like to be able to extend some of the ideas for
first-order probabilistic languages to the problem of decision making. Current research has
shown that this extension is possible and has significant benefits, as discussed in the notes at
the end of the chapter.
