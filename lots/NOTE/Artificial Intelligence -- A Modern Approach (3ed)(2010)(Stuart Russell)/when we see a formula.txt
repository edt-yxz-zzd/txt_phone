constant: sigma[X2X]^2, sigma[X2Z]^2
observation: z[t+1]
prev: mu[T2X][t], sigma[T2X][t]^2

    mu[T2X][t+1] = {(sigma[T2X][t]^2 + sigma[X2X]^2)*z[t+1] + sigma[X2Z]^2 * mu[T2X][t]}/(sigma[T2X][t]^2 + sigma[X2X]^2 + sigma[X2Z]^2)
    sigma[T2X][t+1]^2 = (sigma[T2X][t]^2 + sigma[X2X]^2)*sigma[X2Z]^2/(sigma[T2X][t]^2 + sigma[X2X]^2 + sigma[X2Z]^2)
First, we can interpret the calculation for the new mean mu[T2X][t+1] as simply a weighted mean of the new observation z[t+1] and the old mean mu[T2X][t].
    If the observation is unreliable, then sigma[X2Z]^2 is large and we pay more attention to the old mean;
    if the old mean is unreliable (sigma[T2X][t]^2 is large) or the process is highly unpredictable (sigma[X2X]^2 is large), then we pay more attention to the observation.
Second, notice that the update for the variance sigma[T2X][t+1]^2 is independent of the observation. We can therefore compute in advance what the sequence of variance values will be.
Third, the sequence of variance values converges quickly to a fixed value that depends only on sigma[X2X]^2 and sigma[X2Z]^2, thereby substantially simplifying the subsequent calculations. (See Exercise 15.12.)

    Believe it or not, these equations make some intuitive sense.
    For example, consider the update for the mean state estimate Mu.
    The term F*Mu[t] is the predicted state at t+1,
    so H*F*Mu[t] is the predicted observation.
    Therefore, the term z[t+1]-H*F*Mu[t] represents the error in the predicted observation.
    This is multiplied by K[t+1] to correct the predicted state;
    hence, K[t+1] is a measure of how seriously to take the new observation relative to the prediction.
