[page272-273] Section 7.7. Agents Based on Propositional Logic
# satisfiability surprises
# both L[1,1](0) and L[2,1](0) be true.
One might ask, “Didn’t we say the agent is in [1,1] at time 0?”
Yes, we did, but we didn’t tell the agent that it can’t be in two places at once!
For entailment,L[2,1](0) is unknown and cannot, therefore, be used in a proof;
for satisfiability, on the other hand,L[2,1](0) is unknown and can, therefore, be set to whatever value helps to make the goal true.
For this reason, SATPLAN is a good debugging tool for knowledge bases because it reveals places where knowledge is missing. In this particular case, we can fix the knowledge base by asserting that, at each time step, the agent is in exactly one location, using a collection of sentences similar to those used to assert the existence of exactly one wumpus.
