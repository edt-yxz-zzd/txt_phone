The stochastic dominance condition might seem rather technical and perhaps not so
easy to evaluate without extensive probability calculations. In fact, it can be decided very
easily in many cases. Suppose, for example, that the construction transportation cost depends
on the distance to the supplier. The cost itself is uncertain, but the greater the distance, the
greater the cost. IfS1 is closer than S2,thenS1 will dominateS2 on cost. Although we
will not present them here, there exist algorithms for propagating this kind of qualitative
information among uncertain variables in qualitative probabilistic networks, enabling a

system to make rational decisions based on stochastic dominance, without using any numeric
values.
