Unfortunately, the real outcome will usually be significantlyworsethan we estimated,
even though the estimate was unbiased! To see why, consider a decision problem in which
there are kchoices, each of which has true estimated utility of 0. Suppose that the error in
each utility estimate has zero mean and standard deviation of 1, shown as the bold curve in
Figure 16.3. Now, as we actually start to generate the estimates, some of the errors will be
negative (pessimistic) and some will be positive (optimistic). Because we select the action
with thehighestutility estimate, we are obviously favoring the overly optimistic estimates,
and that is the source of the bias.
