The MEU principleformalizes the general notion that the agent should “do the right
thing,” but goes only a small distance toward a full operationalizationof that advice. Es-timating the state of the world requires perception, learning, knowledge representation, and
inference. Computing P(RESULT(a)|a,e)requires a complete causal model of the world
and, as we saw in Chapter 14, NP-hard inference in (very large) Bayesian networks. Comput-ing the outcome utilities U(s

)often requires searching or planning, because an agent may
not know how good a state is until it knows where it can get to from that state. So, decision
theory is not a panacea that solves the AI problem—but it does provide a useful framework.
