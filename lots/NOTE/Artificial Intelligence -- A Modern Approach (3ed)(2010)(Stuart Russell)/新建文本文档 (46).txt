Many real-world problems have
hidden variables(sometimes calledlatent variables), which are not observable in the data LATENT VARIABLE
that are available for learning. For example, medical records often include the observed
symptoms, the physician’s diagnosis, the treatment applied, and perhaps the outcome of the
treatment, but they seldom contain a direct observation of the disease itself! (Note that the
diagnosisis not thedisease; it is a causal consequence of the observed symptoms, which are in
turn caused by the disease.) One might ask, “If the disease is not observed, why not construct
a model without it?” The answer appears in Figure 20.10, which shows a small, fictitious
diagnostic model for heart disease. There are three observable predisposing factors and three
observable symptoms (which are too depressing to name). Assume that each variable has
three possible values (e.g., none, moderate,andsevere). Removing the hidden variable
from the network in (a) yields the network in (b); the total number of parameters increases
from 78 to 708. Thus, latent variables can dramatically reduce the number of parameters
required to specify a Bayesian network. This, in turn, can dramatically reduce the amount of
data needed to learn the parameters.
