@x. (P x => Q x)
?x. (P x /\ Q x)

@x. (P x /\ Q x)
    <==> (@x. P x) /\ (@x. Q x)
?x. (P x => Q x)
    <==> ?x. (not (P x) \/ Q x)
    <==> (?x. not (P x)) \/ (?x. Q x)
Just as => appears to be the natural connective to use with @,
    /\ is the natural connective to use with ?.
Using /\ as the main connective with @ led to an overly strong statement in the example in the previous section;
    using => with ? usually leads to a very weak statement, indeed.
