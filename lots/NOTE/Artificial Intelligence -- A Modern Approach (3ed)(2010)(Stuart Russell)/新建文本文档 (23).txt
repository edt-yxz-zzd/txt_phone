pruning and information gain look similar,
so why not combine them using an approach calledearly stopping—have the decision tree EARLY STOPPING
algorithm stop generating nodes when there is no good attribute to split on, rather than going
to all the trouble of generating nodes and then pruning them away. The problem with early
stopping is that it stops us from recognizing situations where there is no one good attribute,
but there are combinations of attributes that are informative. For example, consider the XOR
function of two binary attributes. If there are roughly equal number of examples for all four
combinations of input values, then neither attribute will be informative, yet the correct thing
to do is to split on one of the attributes (it doesn’t matter which one), and then at the second
level we will get splits that are informative. Early stopping would miss this, but generate-and-then-prune handles it correctly.
