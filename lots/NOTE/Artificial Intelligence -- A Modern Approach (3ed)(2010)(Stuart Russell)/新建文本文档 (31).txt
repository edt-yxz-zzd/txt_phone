Most nonparametric models have the advantage that it is easy to do leave-one-out cross-validation without having to recompute everything. With ak-nearest-neighbors model, for
instance, when given a test example(x,y)we retrieve theknearest neighbors once, compute
the per-example loss L(y, h(x))from them, and record that as the leave-one-out result for
every example that is not one of the neighbors. Then we retrieve thek+1nearest neighbors
and record distinct results for leaving out each of thekneighbors. WithNexamples the
whole process isO(k), not O(kN).
