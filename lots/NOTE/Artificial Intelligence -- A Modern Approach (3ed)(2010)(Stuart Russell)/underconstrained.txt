then-queens problem—thought to be quite tricky for back-tracking search algorithms—turned out to be trivially easy for local search methods, such as min-conflicts.
This is because solutions are very densely distributed in the space of assignments, and any initial assignment is guaranteed to have a solution nearby.
Thus,n-queens is easy because it is underconstrained. UNDERCONSTRAINED
