why P(effect|cause) instead of P(cause|effect)?

One obvious question to ask about Bayes' rule is why one might have available the conditional probability in one direction, but not the other.
    In the meningitis domain, perhaps the doctor knows that a stiff neck implies meningitis in 1 out of 5000 cases; that is, the doctor has quantitative information in the diagnostic direction from symptoms to causes. Such a doctor has no need to use Bayes' rule.
    Unfortunately,diagnostic knowledge is often more fragile than causal knowledge.
        If there is a sudden epidemic of meningitis, the unconditional probability of meningitis, P(m), will go up.
            The doctor who derived the diagnostic probability P(m|s) directly from statistical observation of patients before the epidemic will have no idea how to update the value,
            but the doctor who computes P(m|s) from the other three values will see that P(m|s) should go up proportionately with P(m).
    Most important, the causal information P(s|m) is unaffected by the epidemic, because it simply reflects the way meningitis works.
        The use of this kind of direct causal or model-based knowledge provides the crucial robustness needed to make probabilistic systems feasible in the real world.
