[page 381] Section 10.3. Planning Graphs
    Interference: one of the effects of one action is the negation of a precondition of the other. For example Eat(Cake) interferes with the persistence of Have(Cake) by negating its precondition.
        // MIT OpenCourseWare lecture on GraphPlan and making planning graphs[page 31]
        // The next case is called interference. If one action deletes the preconditions of another - then that's also a case where you can't execute the two actions at the same time. Because remember, we said that when we had one of these plans that had two action steps at the same point in time, our assumption was that you could linearize them in either order, and clearly, if one deletes a precondition of the other then you can't linearize them in any order, so that's not OK.
