Artificial Intelligence -- A Modern Approach (3ed)(2010)(Stuart Russell) :: Section 17.6. Mechanism Design :: common goods

The standard approach for dealing with the tragedy of the commons is to change the
mechanism to one that charges each agent for using the commons.


The
city wants to allocate the goods efficiently, to the neighborhoods that would value them the
most. That is, they want to maximize the global utilityV =

i
vi. The problem is that if
they just ask each neighborhood council “how much do you value this free gift?” they would
all have an incentive to lie, and report a high value. It turns out there is a mechanism, known
as theVickrey-Clarke-Groves,orVCG, mechanism, that makes it a dominant strategy for
VICKREY-CLARKE-GROVES
VCG each agent to report its true utility and that achieves an efficient allocation of the goods. The
trick is that each agent pays a tax equivalent to the loss in global utility that occurs because
of the agent’s presence in the game.
