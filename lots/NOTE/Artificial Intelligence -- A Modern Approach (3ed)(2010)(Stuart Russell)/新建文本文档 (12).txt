A system that incorporates utilities can avoid one of the most common pitfalls associ-ated with the consultation process: confusing likelihood and importance. A common strategy
in early medical expert systems, for example, was to rank possible diagnoses in order of like-lihood and report the most likely. Unfortunately, this can be disastrous! For the majority of
patients in general practice, the two mostlikelydiagnoses are usually “There’s nothing wrong
with you” and “You have a bad cold,” but if the third most likely diagnosis for a given patient
is lung cancer, that’s a serious matter. Obviously, a testing or treatment plan should depend
both on probabilities and utilities.
