If an agent acts so as to maximize a utility function that correctly reflects the performance
measure, then the agent will achieve the highest possible performance score (averaged over
all the possible environments). This is the central justification for the MEU principle itself.
While the claim may seem tautological, it does in fact embody a very important transition
from a global, external criterion of rationality—the performance measure over environment
histories—to a local, internal criterion involving the maximization of a utility function applied
to the next state.
