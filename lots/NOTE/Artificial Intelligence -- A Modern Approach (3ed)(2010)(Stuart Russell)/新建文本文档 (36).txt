The CURRENT-BEST-LEARNINGalgorithm is described nondeterministically, because at any
point, there may be several possible specializations or generalizations that can be applied. The
choices that are made will not necessarily lead to the simplest hypothesis, and may lead to an
unrecoverable situation where no simple modification of the hypothesis is consistent with all
of the data. In such cases, the program must backtrack to a previous choice point.
The CURRENT-BEST-LEARNINGalgorithm and its variants have been used in many
machine learning systems, starting with Patrick Winston’s (1970) “arch-learning” program.
With a large number of examples and a large space, however, some difficulties arise:
1. Checking all the previous examples over again for each modification is very expensive.
2. The search process may involve a great deal of backtracking. As we saw in Chapter 18,
hypothesis space can be a doubly exponentially large place.
