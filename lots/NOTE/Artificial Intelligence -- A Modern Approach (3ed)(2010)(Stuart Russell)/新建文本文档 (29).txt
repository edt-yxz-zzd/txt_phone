Often p=2is used if the dimensions are measuring similar properties, such HAMMING DISTANCE
as the width, height and depth of parts on a conveyor belt, and Manhattan distance is used if
they are dissimilar, such as age, weight, and gender of a patient. Note that if we use the raw
numbers from each dimension then the total distance will be affected by a change in scale
in any dimension. That is, if we change dimension ifrom measurements in centimeters to

miles while keeping the other dimensions the same, we’ll get different nearest neighbors. To
avoid this, it is common to applynormalizationto the measurements in each dimension. One NORMALIZATION
simple approach is to compute the meanμi and standard deviationσi of the values in each
dimension, and rescale them so thatxj,i becomes(xj,i−μi)/σi. A more complex metric
known as theMahalanobis distancetakes into account the covariance between dimensions.
