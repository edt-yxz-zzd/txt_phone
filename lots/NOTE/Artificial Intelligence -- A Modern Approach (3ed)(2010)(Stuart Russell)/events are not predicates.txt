events are not predicates
    By reifying events we make it possible to add any amount of arbitrary information about them. For example, we can say that Shankar's flight was bumpy with Bumpy(E1).
    In an ontology where events are n-ary predicates, there would be no way to add extra information like this; moving to an n+1-ary predicate isn't a scalable solution.

#Reification is making something real, bringing something into being, or making something concrete.
#Reification in knowledge representation is the process of turning a predicate into an object.
