The kernel method can be applied not only with learning algorithms that find optimal
linear separators, but also with any other algorithm that can be reformulated to work only
with dot products of pairs of data points, as in Equations 18.13 and 18.14. Once this is
done, the dot product is replaced by a kernel function and we have akernelizedversion KERNELIZATION
of the algorithm. This can be done easily fork-nearest-neighbors and perceptron learning
(Section 18.7.2), among others.
