Now, if every HMM is a DBN and every
DBN can be translated into an HMM, what’s the difference? The difference is that,by de-
Section 15.5. Dynamic Bayesian Networks 591
composing the state of a complex system into its constituent variables, the can take advantage
ofsparsenessin the temporal probability model. Suppose, for example, that a DBN has 20
Boolean state variables, each of which has three parents in the preceding slice. Then the
DBN transition model has20×2
3
=160probabilities, whereas the corresponding HMM has
2
20
states and therefore2
40
, or roughly a trillion, probabilities in the transition matrix. This
is bad for at least three reasons: first, the HMM itself requires much more space; second,
the huge transition matrix makes HMM inference much more expensive; and third, the prob-lem of learning such a huge number of parameters makes the pure HMM model unsuitable
for large problems. The relationship between DBNs and HMMs is roughly analogous to the
relationship between ordinary Bayesian networks and full tabulated joint distributions.
