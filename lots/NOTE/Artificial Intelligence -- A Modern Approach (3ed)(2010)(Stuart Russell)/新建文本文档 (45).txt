But even if the structure describes the true causal nature of the domain,
statistical fluctuations in the data set mean that the equation will never be satisfiedexactly,
so we need to perform a suitable statistical test to see if there is sufficient evidence that the
independence hypothesis is violated. The complexity of the resulting network will depend
on the threshold used for this testâ€”the stricter the independence test, the more links will be
added and the greater the danger of overfitting.
