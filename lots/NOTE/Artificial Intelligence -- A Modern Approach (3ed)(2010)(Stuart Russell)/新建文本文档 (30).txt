We decide how much to weight each example with a function known as akernel.A KERNEL
kernel function looks like a bump; in Figure 18.29 we see the specific kernel used to generate
Figure 18.28(d). We can see that the weight provided by this kernel is highest in the center
and reaches zero at a distance of±5. Can we choose just any function for a kernel? No. First,
note that we invoke a kernel functionKwithK(Distance(xj,xq)),wherexqis a query point
that is a given distance from xj, and we want to know how much to weight that distance.
SoKshould be symmetric around 0 and have a maximum at 0. The area under the kernel
must remain bounded as we go to±∞. Other shapes, such as Gaussians, have been used for
kernels, but the latest research suggests that the choice of shape doesn’t matter much. We
do have to be careful about the width of the kernel. Again, this is a parameter of the model
that is best chosen by cross-validation. Just as in choosing thekfor nearest neighbors, if the
kernels are too wide we’ll get underfitting and if they are too narrow we’ll get overfitting.
