semantic networks - default values
    One of the most important aspects of semantic networks is their ability to represent default values for categories.  Examining Figure 12.5 carefully, one notices that John has one leg, despite the fact that he is a person and all persons have two legs.
    In a strictly logical KB, this would be a contradiction, but in a semantic network, the assertion that all persons have two legs has only default status; that is, a person is assumed to have two legs unless this is contradicted by more specific information.
    The default semantics is enforced naturally by the inheritance algorithm, because it follows links upwards from the object itself (John in this case) and stops as soon as it finds a value. We say that the default is overridden by the more specific value.
    Notice that we could also override the default number of legs by creating a category of OneLeggedPersons, a subset of Persons of which John is a member.
