The unsupervised clustering problem, then, is to recover a mixture model like the one
in Figure 20.11(a) from raw data like that in Figure 20.11(b). Clearly, if weknewwhich com-ponent generated each data point, then it would be easy to recover the component Gaussians:
we could just select all the data points from a given component and then apply (a multivariate
version of) Equation (20.4) (page 809) for fitting the parameters of a Gaussian to a set of data.
On the other hand, if weknewthe parameters of each component, then we could, at least in
a probabilistic sense, assign each data point to a component. The problem is that we know
neither the assignments nor the parameters.
