There are two principal drawbacks to the version-space approach:
•If the domain contains noise or insufficient attributes for exact classification, the version
space will always collapse.
•If we allow unlimited disjunction in the hypothesis space, the S-set will always contain
a single most-specific hypothesis, namely, the disjunction of the descriptions of the
positive examples seen to date. Similarly, the G-set will contain just the negation of the
disjunction of the descriptions of the negative examples.
•For some hypothesis spaces, the number of elements in the S-set or G-set may grow
exponentially in the number of attributes, even though efficient learning algorithms exist
for those hypothesis spaces.
