Why should variable selection be fail-first, but value selection be fail-last?
    It turns out that, for a wide variety of problems, a variable ordering that chooses a variable with the minimum number of remaining values helps minimize the number of nodes in the search tree by pruning larger parts of the tree earlier.
    For value ordering, the trick is that we only need one solution; therefore it makes sense to look for the most likely values first. If we wanted to enumerate all solutions rather than just find one, then value ordering would be irrelevant.
