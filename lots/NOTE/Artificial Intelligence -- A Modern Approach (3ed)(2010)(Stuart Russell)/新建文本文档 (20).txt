In the previous section, we asked, “Given a game, what is a rational strategy?” In this sec-tion, we ask, “Given that agents pick rational strategies, what game should we design?” More
specifically, we would like to design a game whose solutions, consisting of each agent pursu-ing its own rational strategy, result in the maximization of some global utility function. This
problem is calledmechanism design, or sometimes inverse game theory. Mechanism de- MECHANISM DESIGN
sign is a staple of economics and political science.
