Besides its flexibility, the beta family has another wonderful property: ifΘhas a prior
beta[a, b], then, after a data point is observed, the posterior distribution for Θis also a beta
distribution. In other words,betais closed under update. The beta family is called the
conjugate priorfor the family of distributions for a Boolean variable.
