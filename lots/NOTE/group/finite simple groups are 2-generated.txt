    if you pick two random elements from a finite simple group, then they generate the whole group with probability which tends to 1 as the size of the group grows.

        Abstract
            For each finite simple group G there is a conjugacy class C[G] such that each nontrivial element of G generates G together with any of more than 1/10 of the members of C[G]. Precise asymptotic results are obtained for the probability implicit in this assertion. Similar results are obtained for almost simple groups.




    The generating graph of a group has the nonidentity elements of G as vertices, where to vertices are connected if they generate the group.

        The generating graph of a finite group G is a graph whose vertices are the elements of G, and with an edge between x and y if and only if x and y generate G. This is clearly only an interesting object for groups that are 2-generated, but fortunately a great many interesting families of groups are 2-generated, including all finite simple groups.
