nonplanar condition of ugraph

K[3,3]-like     or  K[5]-like
6               or  5           num-end-vertices
9               or  10          simple-nonempty-paths


no begin_vertex of any simple_nonemtpy_path is end_vertex of any simple_nonemtpy_path
simple_nonemtpy_paths may have common begin_vertex
simple_nonemtpy_paths may have common end_vertex
simple_nonemtpy_paths have distinguish middle vertices
    i.e. not cross/interset


how to find out?
    try to embedding ugraph in plane
