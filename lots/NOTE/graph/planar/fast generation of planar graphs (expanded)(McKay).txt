fast generation of planar graphs (expanded)(McKay).pdf


simple = neither parallel edges nor loops
plane_graph = planar_graph+planar_embedding
dual_graph of plane_graph is plane_graph
  # embedding can be on any surface
  # dual_graph can refer to any graph+embedding, not only plane_graph
  # embedding = cyclic order of incident hedges of each vertex
 dual graph of a triangulation is a cubic graph
  triangulation = 3 edges per face
  cubic = 3 edges per vertex
separating cycle in a plane graph is a cycle that contains at least one vertex in its interior and at least one vertex in its exterior.
  ie. cycle which is not a face





local-def:
  of plane_graph
  orientation-preserving isomorphism (OP-isomorphism)
  orientation-reversing isomorphism (OR-isomorphism)
  isomorphism = OP-isomorphism | OR-isomorphism
automorphism group Aut(G) of a plane graph is the group of all isomorphisms 
from G to itself
OP-automorphism group AutOP(G) is the group of all OP-isomorphisms from G to itself

In some cases, AutOP(G) = Aut(G)
  ; otherwise, AutOP(G) is a subgroup of index 2 of Aut(G) whose other coset consists of the OR-automorphisms.
