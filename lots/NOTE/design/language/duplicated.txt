we always duplicate "code/comment/base_class_method",
    so that reading source-code need not be yo-yo
but problem: how to keep them consistence?

language builtins keyword to force them be the same:
    import from the source definition
    here is duplicated with NAME:
        ... # code/comment

some base_class_method that very simple
    or a transparent document_public final method
    should be copied directly into the derived class
