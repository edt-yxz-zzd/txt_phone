namespace = package = domain


1) full description name/file
    we can a namespace into public and protected and private part:
        public1.public2::protected1.public3.protected2::private1.private2
        ((public|protected|private)\.)*
        at least 1 protected section (for person or org)
    why?
        each name should be unique
        we need a full description to distinguish them.
        too long to write them inside every source files.
        we use a file to store a full description.

        there are too many such description files if every package need one
        so we assume only the names in protected section need a file
        the names in public section are used by anybody
        the names in private section are ensured unique by the author/org of protected section

    full-description-file is a binary file
        the only operation of it is to compare the content with other's
        the only requirement of it is every person/org has a unique content.

        a possible implement:
            content = rb'(?P<encoding>[^\n]*)\n(?P<text>.*)'
            assert len(content) >= 1024
            text = text.decode(encoding.decode('utf8'))
            text maybe:
                when created: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
                where: earth/China/...
                who: ...
                ID of the time:
                    e-mail/person-ID/phone/website/ID@website
                    what I'm doing now
                    ...
                public key:
                    algo:key
                ...
                ...




2) open std API such as OpenGL, C++ STL
    pure versioned public API
        donot contain inline/constexpr function body
        unless their implement are parts of the API std.
        so we should offer another protected API with inline implement.

    compile with std API only to verify
    compile with impl API to link

    std default/possible impl // depend on the core std API
    personal replacement impl // better, by-pass the core std API
3) personal local short name
    * each person has a unique global default person-short-name-ref folder
        this folder contains other persons' full-description-file named by person prefered short name
        "mine" is a keyword always refer to myself

        # a MUST to use others' packages
        public math::public algebra::public group::protected XXX[who]::...

    * each person has a unique (global/per protected package) default package-short-name-ref folder
        group = public math::public algebra::public group
        group::
            using protected XXX[who]
            using YYY = protected XXX[who]


        # now:
        public math::public algebra::public group::protected XXX[who]::...
        <==> group.XXX
