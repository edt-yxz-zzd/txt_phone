we compile high language into low language
for text middle language, we want the higher language's file name and line number as debug-info

there are many dialects, and many intermediate language layers
we need special comment to support such usage:
    # 0. compiler name, options, input file names
    # 1. compiler name, options, input file names
    # 2. compiler name, options, input file names
    ...
    # 0. dialect name, file name, line range, begin column, end column
    # 1. dialect name, file name, line range, begin column, end column
    # 2. dialect name, file name, line range, begin column, end column
    ...
        // where 0 is the highest/most-derived language
