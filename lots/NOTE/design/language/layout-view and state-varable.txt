layout-view and state-varable

we should have 2 interface files:
    one exports: what elements the layout may define.
        controller can play with them if exists.
        layout.xml
            imports widget classes
            defines named instances
            descripts widget relationship
        widget class in 2 form: .xml .src_code
    another exports: what varables the controller using.
        layout.configuration.xml can initial states
