Chapter 2. XSLT in Action
Installing and Using an XML Editor
[page14]

WmHelp XMLPad......................http://www.wmhelp.com/
    iOS, Windows
    A surprisingly full-featured editor for XML, XSL, and related standards. You can close the "project" windows and work with loose files for this book.

XML Copy Editor...............http://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.net/
    Windows, Linux
    Uncomplicated and to the point. Not quite as full-featured as XMLPad, but easy to use for the purposes of this book
jEdit...............................http://www.jedit.org/
    Mac OS, OS/2, Unix/Linux, VMS, Windows
    A full-featured, Java-based development editor; you’ll need to install the XML and XSL plugins, but that’s pretty easy. The interface is a little clunkier than the other two editors on this list.
