XSL Transformations 1.0
[page 87] declarative programming model
    XSLT defines several built-in templates that exist as part of every program unless they’re explicitly overridden. The built-in templates have a profound effect on the programming model. For the root node and element nodes, the built-in template calls apply-templatesto continue processing all child nodes. For attribute and text nodes, the built-in template simply outputs the node’s value. For all other node types, the built-in template does nothing. See Section 5.5 for more details.


5.5 Built-in templates

    Built-in template syntax
        <xsl:template match="*|/">
            <xsl:apply-templates/>
        </xsl:template>
        <xsl:template match="text()|@*">
            <xsl:value-of select="."/>
        </xsl:template>
        <xsl:template match="processing-instruction()|comment()"/>
    In addition to these built-in templates, there is also a set of built-in templates for each mode used in the document (see templatefor more details):
        <xsl:template match="*|/" mode="m">
            <xsl:apply-templates mode="m"/>
        </xsl:template>
    These built-in templates can be explicitly overridden to change this default behavior.
