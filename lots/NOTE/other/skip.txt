when debugging
we may want to skip a block of code

comment out:
    by tool:
        in Python IDLE:
            alt+3 : comment out region
            alt+4 : uncomment region
            but what if we has no such tool on hand?? 
    by hand:
        in Java:
            /*
            block
            // */
        in Python:
            '''
            block
            #'''
        in Haskell:
            {-
            block
            -- -}
        but we have to modify two places at initial
        and maybe not allow nested comments

ignore:
    by condition:
        if (false) {
        block
        }
        but two places
    by unconditional jump:
        {
            // working
            return/continue/break
            // ignore
        }
        but not always possible (e.g. outside function)
        and Java forbid such usage

new keyword: skip - goto end of this scope
    in file/class/function/local... scope
    {
        // working
        skip
        // ignore
    }
