[SM]R[SM]W (safe|regular|atomic) register

1) all registers can be implemented by SRSW safe register
2) all registers can be replace directly by MRMW atomic register


problem:
    given SRSW safe register and MRMW atomic register
    that is, there are two implements for other registers
    how to choose one implement as default?
    
    DAG:
        we set some middle vertices to be one of its descendant
        
    
relative:
    more basic class found later than subclass
    Haskell: Monad, then Functor
    
    be a Functor then Monad
    or Monad auto be Functor??
