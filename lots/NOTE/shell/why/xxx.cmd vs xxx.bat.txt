.cmd vs .bat vs .ps1


a.ps1 for "Power Shell" not for DOS

a.bat/
    @rem ERRORLEVEL will not be changed
    return0

    @rem ERRORLEVEL := 1
    return1
a.cmd/
    @rem ERRORLEVEL := 0
    return0

    @rem ERRORLEVEL := 1
    return1

The differences between .CMD and .BAT as far as CMD.EXE is concerned are: With extensions enabled, PATH/APPEND/PROMPT/SET/ASSOC in .CMD files will set ERRORLEVEL regardless of error. .BAT sets ERRORLEVEL only on errors.

IMO, that's the main point. You use .cmd as extension for newer scripts when you want to make sure they are not exececuted on older 16-bit OSs, or if you are not sure they will work.

    .bat is older, be interpreted by command.com and cmd.exe
    .cmd is newer, only be interpreted by cmd.exe
