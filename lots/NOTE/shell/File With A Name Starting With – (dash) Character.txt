File With A Name Starting With – (dash) Character

* "-" is the file name of stdin
    should use ".../-" to avoid "-"
    e.g.
        ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i - -c copy 20516451.flv
* file name "-f"
    rm ./-f
    rm -- -f
        Any unix utility that uses getopt will see the — as an end of options.
