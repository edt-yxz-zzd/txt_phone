assume we handle text instead of bytes
1. write_cmd | read_cmd
    write_cmd must use SHELL.encoding to write out text
    so read_cmd should use SHELL.encoding to read text from STDIN
2. read_cmd <a.txt
    like above, use SHELL.encoding
3. read_cmd --encoding gbk --input a.txt
    read_cmd use "gbk" to read text from "a.txt"
4. read_cmd --encoding gbk <a.txt
    read_cmd use "gbk" or use SHELL.encoding to read text from STDIN??
    should use "gbk"
==>>
    read_cmd <==> read_cmd --encoding="default:<SHELL.encoding>"
