assume "-" begins an option
then positional argument cannot starts with "-"
but positional argument should take any string.


partial solution:
    "--" <==> cmd ... -- positional_argument*
        but positional_argument may be not at last
    "-path-startswith-" ==>> "./-path-startswith-"
        but positional_argument may be not a path
