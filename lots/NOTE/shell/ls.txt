why not parse ls?
    --quoting-style=escape
    The problem with ls is that it mangles file names. Parsing its output is fragile (it doesn't work with “weird” file names). For comparing two directory listings, it's ok as long as the output is unambiguous. With arbitrary file names, this would require an option such as --quoting-style=escape
