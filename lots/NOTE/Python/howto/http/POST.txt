        with data={soup['name']:soup['value']
            for soup in form_soup.find_all(hasattr 'name'&'value')}
            # hence not include 'submit'
        with headers.referrer = ...
2. allow_redirects=True

What you need to understand about HTML forms and POST requests is that when you click a submit button on a form it sends the value attribute of any field with a name attribute. The input field with the type submit doesn't get sent for example. It has no name.

<td align="center" colspan="2">
    <input type="hidden" name="inLeader" value>
    <input type="hidden" name="inMember" value>
    <input type="hidden" name="version" value="0">
    <input type="hidden" name="key" value="2013:a:c:3:2s">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit declaration">
    <input type="reset" value="Reset form">
</td>

Okay, your payload is wrong. BUT. I'm not sure if changing it will actually help because you didn't include the error message you are receiving.

payload = {
    'inLeader':'',
    'inMember':'',
    'version':'0',
    'key':'2013:a:c:3:2s',
}
