is python list using contiguous memory?

      python list donot use a whole contiguous memory chunk
    但！从CPython.listobject的源代码看，Python.list确实是 单个C语言数组

What is the maximum size of list in Python?


Maximum length of a list is platform dependent and depends upon address space and/or RAM. The maxsize constant defined in sys module returns 2**63-1 on 64 bit system.

>>> import sys
>>> sys.maxsize
   9223372036854775807

The largest positive integer supported by the platform's Py_ssize_t type, is the maximum size lists, strings, dicts, and many other containers can have.

What is the maximum file size we can open using Python?
Python Server Side Programming Programming

There is no reachable maximum on the size of a file Python can open. People regularly load gigabytes of data into memory. Depending on your computer's RAM and whether it's 64- or 32- bit OS/processor, the practical maximum for you may be anywhere from 1 GB up before you get a MemoryError. Python has no problems with large strings, until you hit the limit of your RAM, operating system, or processor.

What is the maximum size of a document in MongoDB?
MongoDB Database Big Data Analytics

The document is a record in a collection. Each document has the limitation of 16 MB size. The document is wrapped inside the curly bracket ({}).

Let us create a collection with documents −

> db.demo748.insertOne({_id:101,Name:"Chris",Age:21});
{ "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : 101 }
> db.demo748.insertOne({_id:102,Name:"Bob",Age:20});
{ "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : 102 }
> db.demo748.insertOne({_id:103,Name:"David",Age:23});
{ "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : 103 }
> db.demo748.insertOne({_id:104,Name:"Sam",Age:19});
{ "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : 104 }

Display all documents from a collection with the help of find() method −

> db.demo748.find();

This will produce the following output −

{ "_id" : 101, "Name" : "Chris", "Age" : 21 }
{ "_id" : 102, "Name" : "Bob", "Age" : 20 }
{ "_id" : 103, "Name" : "David", "Age" : 23 }
{ "_id" : 104, "Name" : "Sam", "Age" : 19 }

What is the maximum size of HTTP header values?
Web Services server HTTP

Most web servers have their own set of size limits on HTTP request headers. The HTTP Header values are restricted by server implementations. The following are the limits of some of the most popular web servers −
Web Server
	Size Limit
Apache
	8K
Nginx
	4K-8K
IIS
	8K-16K
Tomcat
	8K – 48K

If the header size exceeds the above limit, the server returns 413 Entity Too Large error.
