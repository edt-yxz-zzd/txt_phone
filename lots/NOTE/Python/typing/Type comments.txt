a, b, *c = range(5)   # type: float, float, List[float]
for x, y in points:  # type: float, float

from typing import IO

stream = None  # type: IO[str]


The # type: ignore comment should be put on the line that the error refers to:

import http.client
errors = {
    'not_found': http.client.NOT_FOUND  # type: ignore
}

A # type: ignore comment on a line by itself is equivalent to adding an inline # type: ignore to each line until the end of the current indented block. At top indentation level this has effect of disabling type checking until the end of file.
