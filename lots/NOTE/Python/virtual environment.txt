Virtual environmentsare an indispensable part of Python programming. They are an isolated container containing all the software dependencies for a given project. This is important because by default software like Python and Django is installed in the same directory. This causes a problem when you want to work on multiple projects on the same computer. What if Project A uses Django 2.0 but Project B from last year is still on Django 1.10? Without virtual environments this becomes very difficult; with virtual environments it's no problem at all.
