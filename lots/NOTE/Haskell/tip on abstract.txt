    1) hiding actual working type by using newtype and export type ctor
        but not data ctor, and friend functions
        HIDE DATA CONSTRUCTOR
    2) define a typeclass and instance the exported type
        for generic program
        that is a interface that has no implement in mind
        HIDE IMPLEMENT
        
        [page 370] Separating Interface from Implementation
        Another important way to make code more modular involves separating its interface (what the code can do) from its implementation¡ªhow it does it.
        [page 379]
        Defining a monad¡¯s interface through a typeclass has a further benefit. It lets another user hide our implementation in a newtype wrapper and automatically derive instances of just the typeclasses she wants to expose.
