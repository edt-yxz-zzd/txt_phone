    why not use < == > ??
    using a constant int is bad, I think


why ?
    head :: [a]->a
    head [] ?????????????
    So the  only possible valid behavior (omitting infinite loops or crashes) it can have is to return the first element of the pair.
    error :: String -> a -- yeah!!
    

(/ 3) 3 but (- 3) 3 fail...


what class is record type of?
