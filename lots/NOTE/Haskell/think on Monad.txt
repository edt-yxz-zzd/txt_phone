a Monad contains two fields : state and value
    state is a Monoid # semigroup
        >> : mul.op about state
        return : mul.1 of state
    Monad is a Functor about value

a MonadPlus is a ring about state???:
    >> : mul.op
    mzero : mul.0 of state
    mplus : add.op about state
    
    does void "(ma `mplus` mb) >> mc" == 
         void "(ma >> mc) `mplus` (mb >> mc)" 
       hold???
