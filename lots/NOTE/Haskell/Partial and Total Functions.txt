Partial and Total Functions -- unsafe vs safe


Functions that have only return values defined for a subset of valid inputs are called partial functions (calling errordoesn¡¯t qualify as returning a value!). We call functions that return valid results over their entire input domains total functions.


Some Haskell programmers go so far as to give partial functions names that begin with a prefix such as unsafeso that they can¡¯t shoot themselves in the foot accidentally.
It¡¯s arguably a deficiency of the standard  Preludethat it defines quite a few ¡°unsafe¡± partial functions, such as head, without also providing ¡°safe¡± total equivalents.
