    DO YOU WANT YOUR COWORKERS TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN AN INTERVIEW ALL THE TIME?
        Microsoft¡¯s Eric Brechner has talked about how a great interview question should involve at least three variables.* It¡¯s probably because dealing with three variables at the same time forces you to think hard! This makes sense for an interview, where you¡¯re trying to push a candidate to the limit. But do you want your coworkers to feel like they¡¯re in an interview while they¡¯re reading your code?
