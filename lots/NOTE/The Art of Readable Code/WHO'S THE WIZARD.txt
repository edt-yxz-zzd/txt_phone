    WHO'S THE WIZARD?
        A while ago, one of the authors was installing the OpenBSD operating system. 
        During the disk formatting step, a complicated menu appeared, asking for disk parameters. 
        One of the options was to go to "Wizard mode".
        He was relieved to find this user-friendly option and selected it. 
        To his dismay, it dropped the installer into a low-level prompt waiting for manual disk formatting commands, with no clear way to get out of it. 
        Evidently "wizard" meant you were the wizard!
