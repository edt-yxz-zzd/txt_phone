revision vs version

revision: "AD", "overlay", ...
version: "1.2.3435"

revision:
    big changes
    To revise or modify. It is a major release of the software
    A revision represents a change to a document's contents, or a modification to a part such that the part remains interchangeable with its previous variation.

version:
    small changes
    An intermediate software update that typically addresses bugs in the original release but is not seen as a major release of the software
    Versions are commonly used for computer program files to identify
        * a specific set of features,
        * a set of bug fixes, and/or
        * a particular build number.
    For example, a version "1.2.403" may indicate the marketing feature set "1.2" plus the compiler build "403". While you have a very good feel for how many releases are represented in going from revision "AA" to "AD", you'd have little idea whether there were a few releases, or several hundred, between versions "1.2.403" and "2.1.1042".
