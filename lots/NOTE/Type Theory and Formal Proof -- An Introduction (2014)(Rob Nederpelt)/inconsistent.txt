Dafny -- An Automatic Program Verifier for Functional Correctness


There is one more detail about the encoding of the definitional axiom. In Boogie, all declared axioms
are available when discharging proof obligations. Thus, if the axioms are inconsistent, then all proof
obligations can be discharged trivially, even the proof obligations designed to ensure the consistency of
the axioms! To avoid such circularities, Dafny adds an antecedent to each definitional axiom; this lets
the axiom be activated selectively. Let the height of a function be its order in a topological sort of all
functions according to the call graph. For example, mutually recursive functions have the same height.
The antecedent added to the definitional axiom of a function F of height h is h < ContextHeight, where
ContextHeight is an uninterpreted constant. To activate the definitional axioms of non-recursive calls,
the consistency check of function F is given the assumption ContextHeight = h. Proof obligations related
to methods get to assume what amounts to ContextHeight = Â¥, thus activating all definitional axioms.
