[page 199] 9.5 Definition unfolding andδ-conversion
-- why f(a,b) instead of (f a b)
-- substitution all v.s. locally
Remark 9.5.3 Unfolding concernsone occurrence at a time: other occurrences of the same constant are left untouched in the described unfolding step. And this is what we want, since one is usually only ‘locally’ interested in what a constant represents. This differs fromβ-reduction in an essential manner, sinceβ-reduction requires that all bound occurrences of the variable are replaced by the argument. Hence, although the mechanisms of reduction and unfolding are tightly connected to the same basic notion, namely substitution, they behave differently and therefore we treat them in a different manner. That this can be realised in our formalisation is an advantage of the style with parameters that we employ, over the style withλ-abstractions as described in Section 8.11.
