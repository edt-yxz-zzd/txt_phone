when we construct a set, it should have a type.
    otherwise, like:
        s = {a, b, c} and |s|=3
        s' = s \-/ {{a,b}} = {a,b,c,{a,b}}
        |s'| = ??
    power set should be one layer higher than original set
    but:
        {}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}}...
        when we construct a type from set, we should never mix-up diff types.
        since obj in diff type may have same representation
        ;; really? why don't we tag them with their type name:
        ;;  elem -> (type_name, elem)
