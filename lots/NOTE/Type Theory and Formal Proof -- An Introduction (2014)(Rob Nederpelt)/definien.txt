Definition 10.4.2 (Elements of a definition inλD)
    Let D ≡ Γ |> a(x...):= K/_||_ : L be a definition.
    −Γ is the context of D.
    −a is the defined constant of D, with x as parameter list.
    −a(x) is the definiendum of D.
    −K/_||_ : L is the statement of D.
    −K resp. _||_ is the definiens(also called:body) of D.
    −L is the type of D.
If D ≡ Γ |> a(x):= K : L, then the definition is called a descriptive or proper definition, and a is a proper constant.
If D ≡ Γ |> a(x):= _||_ : L, then the definition is called a primitive definition, and a is a primitive constant.
