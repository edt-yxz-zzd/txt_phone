[379] Further perspectives
The soundness of course still depends on the axioms that one has assumed: if the axioms do not correspond to what one wants to formalise, or if they are inconsistent, the derived results are still useless. This already applies to informal mathematics, so the formalisation in type theory is separate from the question of whether the axioms are sound. So in general, one should use axioms sparingly.
