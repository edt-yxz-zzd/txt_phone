What is a SNAPSHOT version?

Notice the value of the version tag in the pom.xml file shown below has the suffix: -SNAPSHOT.

    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
      ...
      <groupId>...</groupId>
      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
      ...
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>
      ...

The SNAPSHOT value refers to the 'latest' code along a development branch, and provides no guarantee the code is stable or unchanging. Conversely, the code in a 'release' version (any version value without the suffix SNAPSHOT) is unchanging.

In other words, a SNAPSHOT version is the 'development' version before the final 'release' version. The SNAPSHOT is "older" than its release.

During the release process, a version of x.y-SNAPSHOT changes to x.y. The release process also increments the development version to x.(y+1)-SNAPSHOT. For example, version 1.0-SNAPSHOT is released as version 1.0, and the new development version is version 1.1-SNAPSHOT.
