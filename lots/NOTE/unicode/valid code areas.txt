        2048:
            U+D800..U+DFFF
    Noncharacters
        66 noncharactercode points
            32
                U+FDD0..U+FDEF
            34=17*2
                :The last two code points of each plane are noncharacters:
                    U+[00..10]FFF[E-F]
        Applications are free to use any of these noncharacter code points internally. They have no standard interpretation when exchanged outside the context of internal use. However, they are not illegal in interchange, nor does their presence cause Unicode text to be ill-formed. The intent of noncharacters is that they are permanently prohibited from being assigned interchangeable meaningsby the Unicode Standard. They are not prohibited from occur-ring in valid Unicode strings which happen to be interchanged. This distinction, which might be seen as too finely drawn, ensures that noncharacters are correctly preserved when “interchanged” internally, as when used in strings in APIs, in other interprocess protocols, or when stored.
