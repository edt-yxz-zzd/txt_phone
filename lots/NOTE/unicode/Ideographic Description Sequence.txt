[page683] Ideographic Variation Mark (U+303E)
    // Interaction with the Ideographic Variation Mark. 
    As with ideographs proper, the Ideographic Variation Mark (U+303E) may be placed before an Ideographic Description Sequence to indicate that the description is merely an approximation of the original ideo-graph desired. A sequence of characters that includes an Ideographic Variation Mark is not an Ideographic Description Sequence.
