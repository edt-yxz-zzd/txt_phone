What Characters Are Included

The character here must be a matching bracket pair with respect to their semantics, as indicated in the char's Unicode name.

Also, all Unicode characters with Unicode Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type property values of Open and Close are included. See: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/BidiBrackets.txt (local copy BidiBrackets.txt)

In particular, the following chars are not included on this page:

• Not include: Chars that merely have the appearance of a matching bracket. For example, {ASCII LESS-THAN SIGN <, GREATER-THAN SIGN >}.

• Not include: Char pairs that are simply mirror images of each ohter. For example, math subset and superset symbols: ⊆ ⊇.

• Not include: Chars that are part of a large bracket for typeset math purposes. For example:

    ⎧
    ⎨
    ⎩
