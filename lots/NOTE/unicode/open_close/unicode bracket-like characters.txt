Unicode Annex #44 :: UnicodeData.txt
    Open and close punctuation characters are denoted
        with Ps (punctuation start) and Pe (punctuation end) in the General_Category field (the third field, delimited by ;).
    Quotation marks are indicated
        with Pi and Pf (initial and final punctuation)
    And some character, like < and >, are used as brackets in some contexts (such as HTML/XML), while they are considered math symbols (Sm) in UnicodeData.txt.
