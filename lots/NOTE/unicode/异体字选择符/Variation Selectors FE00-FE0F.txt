    Number of characters: 16

Variation Selectors is a Unicode block containing 16 Variation Selector format characters (designated VS1 through VS16). They are used to specify a specific glyph variant for a Unicode character. They are currently used to specify standardized variation sequences for mathematical symbols, symbols, 'Phags-pa letters, and CJK unified ideographs corresponding to CJK compatibility ideographs. At present only standardized variation sequences with VS1, VS15 and VS16 have been defined.
