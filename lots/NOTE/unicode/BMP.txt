8.0::2.8 Unicode Allocation
[page44]

Planes
    The Unicode codespace consists of the single range of numeric values from 0 to 10FFFF, but in practice it has proven convenient to think of the code space as divided up into planes of characters¡ªeach plane consisting of 64K code points. 
    The last four hexa-decimal digits in each code point indicate a character¡¯s position inside a plane. 
    The remaining digits indicate the plane. 
Plane 0 == Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
Plane 1 == Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP)
Plane 2 == Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP)
