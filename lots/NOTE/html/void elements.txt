In HTML (up to HTML 4): use <br>
In HTML 5: <br> is preferred, but <br/> and <br /> is also acceptable
In XHTML: <br /> is preferred. Can also use <br/> or <br></br>
Notes:
    <br></br> is not valid in HTML 5, it will be thought of as two line breaks.
    XHTML is case sensitive, HTML is not case sensitive.
    For backward compatibility, some old browsers would parse XHTML as HTML and fail on <br/> but not <br />

Void elements (also sometimes called empty elements, single elements or stand-alone elements) only have a start tag (in the form <tag />), which contains any HTML attributes. They may not contain any children, such as text or other elements. In early versions of HTML, the slash was not required for such elements (<tag> was permissible). The space is not required in HTML, strictly speaking (<tag/> is valid), but is required (<tag />) in XHTML and other XML applications. Two common void elements are <br /> (for a hard line-break, such as in a poem or an address) and <hr /> (for a horizontal rule). Other such elements are often place-holders which reference external files, such as the image (<img />) element. The attributes included in the element will then point to the external file in question. Another example of a void element is <link />, for which the syntax is:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="fancy.css" type="text/css">

This <link /> element points the browser at a style sheet to use when presenting the HTML document to the user. Note that in the HTML syntax, attributes don't have to be quoted if they are composed only of certain characters: letters, digits, the hyphen-minus and the full stop. When using the XML syntax (XHTML), on the other hand, all attributes must be quoted, and a spaced trailing slash is required before the last angle bracket:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="fancy.css" type="text/css" />
