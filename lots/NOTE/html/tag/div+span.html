HTML <span> Tag
HTML <div> Tag
HTML <section> Tag
======================
Definition and Usage
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.
======================
Definition and Usage
The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
