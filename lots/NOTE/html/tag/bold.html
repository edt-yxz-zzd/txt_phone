Definition and Usage
The <b> tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.

Tips and Notes
Note: According to the HTML5 specification, the <b> tag should be used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate. The specification states that headings should be denoted with the <h1> to <h6> tags, emphasized text should be denoted with the <em> tag, important text should be denoted with the <strong> tag, and marked/highlighted text should be denoted with the <mark> tag.

Tip: You can also use the following CSS to set bold text: "font-weight: bold;".
