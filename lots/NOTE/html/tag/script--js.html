HTML <script> Tag
HTML <noscript> Tag
======================
Definition and Usage
The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script (JavaScript).

The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

======================
Tips and Notes
Tip: Also look at the <noscript> element for users that have disabled scripts in their browser, or have a browser that doesn't support client-side scripting.

======================
Attributes
Attribute	Value	Description
async	async	Specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (before parsing completes) (only for external scripts)
crossorigin	anonymous use-credentials	Sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request
defer	defer	Specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing (only for external scripts)
integrity	filehash	Allows a browser to check the fetched script to ensure that the code is never loaded if the source has been manipulated
nomodule	True False	Specifies that the script should not be executed in browsers supporting ES2015 modules
referrerpolicy	no-referrer no-referrer-when-downgrade origin origin-when-cross-origin same-origin strict-origin strict-origin-when-cross-origin unsafe-url	Specifies which referrer information to send when fetching a script
src	URL	Specifies the URL of an external script file
type	scripttype	Specifies the media type of the script

======================
Differences Between HTML and XHTML
In XHTML, the content inside scripts is declared as #PCDATA (instead of CDATA), which means that entities will be parsed.

This means that in XHTML, all special characters should be encoded, or all content should be wrapped inside a CDATA section:

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
let i = 10;
if (i < 5) {
  // some code
}
//]]>
</script>

======================
Default CSS Settings
Most browsers will display the <script> element with the following default values:

script {
  display: none;
}

======================
======================
Definition and Usage
The <noscript> tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support script.

The <noscript> element can be used in both <head> and <body>. When used inside <head>, the <noscript> element could only contain <link>, <style>, and <meta> elements.
