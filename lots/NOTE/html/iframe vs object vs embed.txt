iframe vs object vs embed


http://bencreasy.com/object-versus-embed/

Do I use <img>, <object>, or <embed> for SVG files?
    use <object> for interactive animations and <img> for images.


object vs embed
    use object instead of embed
    <div>
        <object data="[insert resource]" type="[insert MIME type]" style="height: 840px; width: 650px;">
            <embed src="[insert resource]" type="[insert MIME type]" />
            <p>
                It appears you don't have a the proper plugin to load this in your browser.
                You can <a href="[insert resource link]">click here to access the resource.</a>
            </p>
      </object>
    </div>


object vs iframe
    "Object tags (with type="text/html") are basically iframes that also allow parameters".
    But this is wrong: a more informed article by the vendor vzaar states that "[u]nlike the iframe, the HTML (Object) embed cannot handle settings updates dynamically" and finds <object> to be too inflexible for their use case.
