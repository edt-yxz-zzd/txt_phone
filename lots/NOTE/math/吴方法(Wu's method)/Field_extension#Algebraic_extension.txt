It is common to construct an extension field of a given field K as a quotient ring of the polynomial ring K[X] in order to "create" a root for a given polynomial f(X). Suppose for instance that K does not contain any element x with x^2 = −1. Then the polynomial X^2+1 is irreducible in K[X], consequently the ideal generated by this polynomial is maximal, and L=K[X]/(X^2+1) is an extension field of K which does contain an element whose square is −1 (namely the residue class of X).

Algebraic extension

# minimal polynomial, irreducible
An element x of a field extension L:K is algebraic over K if it is a root of a nonzero polynomial with coefficients in K. For example, sqrt(2) is algebraic over the rational numbers, because it is a root of x^2-2. If an element x of L is algebraic over K, the monic polynomial of lowest degree that has x as a root is called the minimal polynomial of x. This minimal polynomial is irreducible over K.

#the_minimal_polynomial_of_over :: Field -> FieldElement -> Polynomial
An element s of L is algebraic over K if and only if the simple extension K(s):K is a finite extension.
    |K(s):K| = polynomial_degree_of_about s (the_minimal_polynomial_of_over K s)


A simple extension is algebraic if and only if it is finite.
