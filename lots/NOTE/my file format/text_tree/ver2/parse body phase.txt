0) remove white line
1) alias "\-+ "
    "\\-* " ==>> "\\ "
    "\\^-* " ==>> "\\^ "
2) escape "?^ "
    op like ";^ " will translated to "; "
    will verify "!^ " too
3) remove free comment
    will remove "! "
4) merge
    will remove "\\ " and "; "
    from last line to first line:
        if current op is "\\ " or "; ":
            while True:
                upper = the upper op
                assert upper have same indent
                if upper is "[]":
                    remove upper line
                    continue
                if upper is "." and current op is "; ":
                    remove upper line
                    continue
                if upper is regex"[\\;#'"+-] ": # content ops
                    merge current payload to upper payload
                    # "; " will insert a newline
                    break
                else:
                    raise

5) alias "..~"/"." to "[]"
6) undo block dedent
    verify paired op and payload/tag
    ensure no stmt between pair dedent beyond the pair
    will remove <<< >>> <>>> ><<<
    will insert ".."
7) remove "[]" if the containing body is not empty after this action
    should be after undo block dedent
    otherwise we can not find out whether siblings exist.
8) verify body follows only nonleaf node '["+-] '
9) verify indent rule and make tmp body for (11)
10) remove "[]"/".." both in lines and the tmp body
11) verify "(^^^|...)[#'"+-]" and then remove them
12) verify only "[#'"+-] " remains and create a body.
