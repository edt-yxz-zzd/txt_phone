what is a tree text?
    a text file which represent a text tree
    encoding?
        donot assume encoding
        cannot have a encoding declaration
        so we begin with a string!!
    newline?
        newline = "\n"
        no other case
        lines = text.split("\n")
        if text[-1:] == newline: assert lines[-1] == ''
            though white lines are ignored
    indent?
        must be spaces = regex" *"
            not "\s*"
    spaces at the end of line?
        should not be removed!!

what is a text tree?
    tree is a node set with edges
    there 3 node types:
        * leaf comment
        * leaf node
        * nonleaf node
    comment may be removed eventually
        there is another kind of comment ("free comment") in tree text.
