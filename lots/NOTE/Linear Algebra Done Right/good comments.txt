Chapter1. Vector Spaces::Sums and Direct Sums
[page14] sum
    When dealing with vector spaces, we are usually interested only in subspaces, as opposed to arbitrary subsets. The union of subspaces is rarely a subspace (see Exercise 9 in this chapter), which is why we usually work with sums rather than unions.

[page15] direct sum
    We will be especially interested in cases where each vector inVcan be uniquely represented in the form above. This situation is so important that we give it a special name: direct sum.
