8 Parallel Programs with Shared Variables::8.3 Semantics
S ¡Ô [x := y || y := x]
(i) x = y = 2,
(ii) x = y = 1,
(iii) x = 2 and y = 1.

S¡ä¡Ô [AC1 := y; x := AC1 || AC2 := x; y := AC2]


Summarizing, in our semantics of parallelism the grain of atomicity was chosen to yield a simple definition. This definition is not realistic, but for programs all of whose atomic actions contain at most one shared variable access, this definition models exactly their execution on conventional computer hardware.


[page 281] 8.4 Verification: Partial Correctness
    The introduction of the atomic region <x := x + 2; done := true> is a typical example of virtual atomicity mentioned in Section 8.3: this atomic region is not a part of the original program; it appears only in its correctness proof.
