[CHAPTER 2]IEEE Ethernet Standards

1980, DIX Ethernet standard by DEC-Intel-Xerox vendor consortium
    <<The Ethernet, A Local Area Network: Data Link Layer and Physical Layer Specifications>>
    1) the operation of Ethernet
    2) a single media system based on thick coaxial cable
    1982, DIX V2.0

Ethernet standard by LMSC
    LMSC = the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee
    MAC - Media Access Control
    ??MAN - metropolitan area network
    <<IEEE 802.3 Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,>>
    == 802.3 CSMA/CD, or just 802.3
    IEEE Standard for Ethernet
    if a technology isn¡¯t specified within the IEEE 802.3 standard, then it isn¡¯t officially Ethernet.
        a different technology, such as 802.11 wireless LANs, referred to as ¡°Ethernet.¡±

    <<IEEE Standard for Ethernet, IEEE Std 802.3-2012 (Revision of IEEE Std 802.3-2008)>>

    MIB - management information base
    MIIs - Media Independent Interfaces
        allow use of selected Physical Layer devices (PHY) for operation over coaxial, twisted-pair or fiber optic cables
    PHY - Physical Layer devices

IEEE Sublayers of Ethernet standard
    a link layer standard
    Layer 2 (the data link layer)
        2) LLC = logical link control
            an IEEE-defined mechanism for identifying the data carried in an Ethernet frame
            independent of the 802.3 Ethernet LAN standard
        1) MAC = media access control
            defines the protocols used to arbitrate access to the Ethernet system
    Layer 1 (the physical layer)
        2) physical signaling sublayer
        1) media specification
    

IEEE Media System Identifiers
    <speed><signaling_type><length(unit:100meter)|media_type>
    10BASE5
        10 - 10 Mb/s
        BASE - baseband
            A system whereby information is directly encoded 
            and impressed upon the transmission medium. 
            At any point on the medium only one information signal 
            at a time can be present without disruption.
        5 - 500 m
        thick coaxial cable
    10BASE2 // thin Ethernet system // Cheapernet
        2 - 185 meter ==>> 200m
    FOIRL = Fiber Optic Inter-Repeater Link
        point-to-point link segment that could be used between repeaters
    10BROAD36
        BROAD - broadband
        Broadband cable systems support multiple services on a single cable 
        by dividing the bandwidth of the cable into separate frequencies, 
        each assigned to a given service. 
    10BASE-T
        T -  twisted-pair (Category 3 #>=3)
    10BASE-F
        F -  fiber optic media

    100BASE-T
        T - both fiber optic and twisted-pair systems
    100BASE-X = 100BASE-TX | 100BASE-FX
        X - signal encoding

            FDDI = Fiber Distributed Data Interface
    100BASE-TX
        # most widely used variety of Fast Ethernet
        two pairs of Category 5 twisted-pair cables
