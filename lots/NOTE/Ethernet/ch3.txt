MAC address = physical/machine address = 6B = 48bits
    to show MAC address
        ipconfig /all
    
    1) unicast address = physical address of an interface
        first bit is 0
        1) globally administered address - second bit is 0
            assigned by manufacturer
            # all DIX Ethernet addresses
            # global unique
            OUI = organizationally unique identifier
                first half of unicast address, 3 bytes
        2) locally administered address - second bit is 1
            # local network unique
    2) broadcast address = all 1's
    3) multicast address - station maintains a list a such addresses to listen
        first bit is 1
        
    bit sequences:
        leftmost byte to rightmost
        but, least significant bit to most significant

transceiver = trans-mitter and re-ceiver
station = network device

Best-Effort Delivery
    very few bit errors or dropped frames

independent of high-level protocols
    TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

Internet Protocol and Ethernet Address
    ARP = Address Resolution Protocol
        from IPv4/IPv6 to MAC in local network
        using broadcast(or specified multicast per high-level protocol) address while asking
        no station responds ==>> drops the packets
        ARP cache = dict<IP, MAC>

    a range of IP addresses are assigned to each separate network
    station knows:
        1) local IP address range
            if destination address in this range
            then using ARP...
        2) the address of at least one router
            if destination address in this range
            then sent packet to routers??
