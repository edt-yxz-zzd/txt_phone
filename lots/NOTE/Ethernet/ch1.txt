[CHAPTER 1]The Evolution of Ethernet
Ethernet is a network technology
LAN = local area network

Aloha Network:
    sharing a common communications channel
    pure Aloha
        acknowledgment or timeout==>>collision==>>a random backoff time
        a maximum channel utilization of about 18%,
        due to the rapidly increasing rate of collisions 
        under increasing load

     slotted Aloha
        assigned transmission slots 
        a master clock to synchronize transmissions
        this increased the maximum utilization of the channel to about 37%

1973, The Invention of Ethernet:
    CSMA/CD - the original channel access protocol specified for Ethernet
              Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
    1) collision detection - a mechanism that detected when a collision occurred
    2) carrier sense - listen before talk
    3) multiple access - supported access to a shared channel by multiple stations
    
    4) a more sophisticated backoff algorithm
    function at up to 100% load

    10 Mb/s
    coaxial Ethernet system
        employ a bus topology
        a failure anywhere on the cable brings the entire network system to a halt, and troubleshooting a cable problem can take a long time.

vendor-neutral
    1979 make Ethernet an open standard
    Metcalfe:The invention of Ethernet as an open, non-proprietary, industry-standard local network was perhaps even more significant than the invention of Ethernet technology itself.
    3Com - computer communication compatibility

late 1980s, twisted-pair Ethernet
    star-wired cabling topology - in which the computers are all connected to a central point.
    much easier to install and manage
    troubleshooting is much easier and quicker as well. 
early 1990s, a structured cabling system standard for twisted-pair cabling systems in buildings
    building-wide
    twisted-pair systems
    telephone industry

1995, 100Mb/s, Fast Ethernet
    both twisted-pair and fiber optic media systems
    multispeed - 10 or 100Mb/s 
                 Auto-Negotiation protocol
                 !! new Ethernet capability
    first for network backbones and later for general computing
1998, 1000 Mb/s, Gigabit Ethernet
    provide faster backbone networks as well as connections to high-performance servers
Reinventing Ethernet for 10, 40, and 100 Gb/s
    not support CSMA/CD shared-channel mode
    full-duplex mode - simultaneously send and receive data
                       i.e. 10 in and 10 out ==>> 20 data throughput
                       !! new Ethernet capability
    fiber optic cables and short-range copper coaxial cables

Reinventing Ethernet for New Capabilities:
    Auto-Negotiation protocol
        multispeed
        full-duplex mode
    PoE = Power over Ethernet
        Ethernet switch provides both data and power
        widely adopted - wireless access


ports - Ethernet interfaces
switch protocols
    not part of the Ethernet standard
    specified in the IEEE 802.1 series of standards
        basic switches - the 802.1D standard
switch types:
    1) campus and enterprise networks
    2) data centers (with special capabilities)
    3) that support carrier and long distance networks
    and more.



goods:
    ability to evolve to meet new needs
    fundamental stability
        maintaining the same basic structure and operation
        doing it all at a reasonable cost. This ,
