obj : a
f : a -> b
g : b -> c
(a -> b)
    is a type with two 'face's: (-a, +b)
a
    is a type with one 'face': (+a)
f $ obj
g . f
    to connect two objects, we connect faces with addition(+) algabra

# but!!! (-a) + (+a) == 0 means the resource (ownership) move/pass/disappear
#       for immutable/copyable autodelete data, 1 means 0 or many.
守恒：相加不为0，则仍需为一个face；直至0为止，face消失。
