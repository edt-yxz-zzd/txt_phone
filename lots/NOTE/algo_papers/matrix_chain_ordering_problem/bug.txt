bug1:

        min(mVi, mVj) > max(mVp,mVq) if arc<Vi,Vj> is above arc<Vp,Vq>
        # should be ">=", since "i == p" is possible

        Lemma 3. Any subpolygon which is bounded by two potential h-arcs of the monotone basic n-gon is itself a monotone polygon.

        #   distinguish: w[v] and invV[v]
        #       w[v] - the weight of vertex v
        #       invV[v] - the index of vertex v in array V
        #       [w[v] < w[u]] ==>> [invV[v] < invV[u]]
        #       [v != u] ==>> [invV[v] != invV[u]]

        #   since potential h-arc s.t. "weak" condition
        #       which require "<" for weights of the two ends.
        # ver1:
        # two ends of either h-arcs may have same weight
        #   the result polygon may have two local max(or min)
        #   does it a monotone polygon?
        #
        # well, if there more than one min, we can cut the polygon.
        #   so, we can assume that one min
        # if one min, and many max, oneside monotone,
        #   then fan is the result!
