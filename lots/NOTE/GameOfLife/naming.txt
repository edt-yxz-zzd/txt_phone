    Most definitions that have a diagram have also some data in brackets after the keyword. Oscillators are maked as pn (where n is a positive integer), meaning that the period is n (p1 indicates a still life). Wicks are marked in the same way but with the word "wick" added. For spaceships the speed (as a fraction of c, the speed of light), the direction and the period are given. Fuses are marked with speed and period and have the word "fuse" added. Wicks and fuses are infinite in extent and so have necessarily been truncated, with the ends stabilized wherever practical.


oscillator - "p<period>"
    still life - p1
wick - "p<period> wick" # burning shorter each period
wickstretcher - spaceship-like object which stretches a wick that is fixed at the other end. (subclass of puffer)
fencepost - pattern that stabilizes one end of a wick
rake - Any puffer whose debris consists of spaceships
reflector - Any stable or oscillating pattern that can reflect some type of spaceship (usually a glider) without suffering permanent damage.
relay - Any oscillator in which spaceships (typically gliders) travel in a loop.
regulator - An object which converts input gliders aligned to some period to output gliders aligned to a different period.
fuse - A wick burning at one end.

spaceship - i.e. "c/5 orthogonally, p30" # c for the speed of light
    since period*speed is a integer, I think "(dx, dy)c/<period>" is fine. 
    (dx, dy per period)
