# UTM (universal Turing machine)
# the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer 
#     with unlimited memory and no time constraints: it is Turing complete.
# "universal constructor" can be built 
#     which contains a Turing complete computer, 
#     and which can build many types of complex objects, 
#     including more copies of itself.


# cellular automaton speed of light
#     because of the nearest-neighbor based rules, 
#     no "information" can travel through the grid 
#     at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, 
#     so this velocity is said to be the cellular automaton speed of light

Variations on Life
    The standard Game of Life is symbolised as "B3/S23": 
        A cell is "Born" if it has exactly 3 neighbours, 
        "Stays alive" if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours; 
        it dies otherwise. 
        
        The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. 
        The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. 
        
        Hence "B6/S16" means "a cell is born if there are 6 neighbours, 
        and lives on if there are either 1 or 6 neighbours".
