5.4 Purely Syntactic Translation

CFG > REG > FC > Const
Const is a family of languages containing only one sentence

where Const are useful?
    A = aBcDeF / FkDkFtC -- replace source by target
        -- which symbols are allowed to present in the target rule?
        --  any target-terminals
        --  any nonterminals presented in current source rule
        --  any target-Const-nonterminals!!!!!!!!!!!!
    C = {} / Const

NOTE:
    in this book, the order and times of nonterminals are not changed.
    I think that was too strict.
    remove, reorder, repeat... and new CONST






[page303] abstract syntax tree(AST)
    Construction of Target Syntax Tree 
        In a translation scheme the rules of the two grammars are in one-to-one correspondence. We observe that corresponding rules have 
            identical left parts and that the nonterminal symbols occur in the same order in their right parts.
    for each alter A -> aBbC... ==>> A -> ?0 B ?1 C... 
        we replace CONST between two nearest nonterminals by abstract object??
        
    each alter have form A -> a0 B1 a1 B2 a2 ... Bt at where a[i] are abstract CONST

    -- NOTE:
        if using a generic form as the above NOTE, then we cannot have a same AST for both source and target



Property 5.7(Unambiguity conditions for translation) Let G¦Ó =(G1,G2) be a translation grammar such that:
    1. the source grammarG1is unambiguous, and
    2. no two rules of the target grammar G2 correspond to the same rule of G1 
        e.g. no A -> BC / ... ; A -> BC / ...;
Then the translation specified by grammar G¦Ó is single valued and defines a translation function.
