    1 Note again that we are not considering here an important branch of process calculi focused on mobility of processes and communication channels, e.g. [149].
[page 216] basic idea
    Before we compare the approaches, it is important not to overlook that, despite the impression that our comparisons may give, the three calculi are, in a broader sense, very similar. This is because all the notations are built upon the basic idea of atomic actions, their combining operators and interleaving (branching-time) semantics. This is the starting point for all the calculi.
    -- atomic actions + combining operators + interleaving semantics
