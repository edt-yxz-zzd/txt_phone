[page 31] 2.3 Primitive Basic LOTOS :: 2.3.4 Nondeterminism
    Nondeterminism goes hand in hand with concurrency. Because, in concurrent systems, components can evolve independently of one another, choices made inside one component can create nondeterminism for the component's environment (i.e. all components that evolve in parallel with it). This is because components cannot "look inside" other components to see why they make a particular choice, thus, to the environment, hidden choices seem nondeterministic.
    -- system = self + env
    -- self contains choices; env makes decisions
    -- self : choices; env : nondetermine


Deterministic Choice
    x;((x1; stop) [] (x2; stop))
Nondeterministic Choice
    (x; x1; stop) [] (x; x2; stop)
