what is PTS?
    see: A Modern Perspective on Type Theory -- From its Origins until Today (2005)(Fairouz Kamareddine)::4c Pure Type Systems

    PTS specification = (Sorts, Axioms, Rules)
        Sorts
            the set of sorts in the PTS
        Axioms <= (Sorts * Sorts)
            [(s0, s1) <- Axioms] ==>> [s0 : s1]
        Rules <= (Sorts * Sorts * Sorts)
            [(i,o,f) <- Rules] ==>> [Env |- ti : i][Env,x:ti |- to : o] ==>> [Env |- (@x:ti.to):f]


property of PTS
    may not normalisation/consistent
    ??weak normalisation ==>> strong normalisation??
    [PTS ==>> not (? x : _L . normalisation x)]
        normalisation PTS ==>> consistent PTS
        [x : _L] ==>> not (normalisation x) ==>> inconsistent PTS

which PTSs are normalisation?

        Theorem 4.40 (Strong Normalisation for ECC)Let A be a legal term in the Extended Calculus of Constructions. Then A is strongly normalising.
