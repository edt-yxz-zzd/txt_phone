impredicativity vs predicativity
f : A -> B
    impredicativity
        A depends on f or (A->B)
    predicativity
        A not depends on f or (A->B)
impredicativity
    f : @A:*:[]. A -> A : *
                         ^^^
    # allow (f (@A:*. A->A) f)
predicativity
    f : @A:*:[]. A -> A : []
                         ^^^
    # not allow (f (@A:*. A->A) f)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impredicativity
Something that is impredicative, in mathematics, logic and philosophy of mathematics, is a self-referencing definition. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building stratified (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is intuitionistic type theory, which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.
