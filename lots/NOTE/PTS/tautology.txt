A minimal tautology is a tautology that is not the instance of a shorter tautology.

not a === a -> _L
a \/ b
    === not a -> b   ==??==>> not b -> a
        a \/ not a === not a -> not a
        not a \/ a === not (not a) -> a === ((a -> _L) -> _L) -> a
    === (a->r) -> (b->r) -> r

A formula R is said to tautologically imply a formula S if every valuation that causes R to be true also causes S to be true. This situation is denoted R |= S. It is equivalent to the formula R -> S being a tautology.
