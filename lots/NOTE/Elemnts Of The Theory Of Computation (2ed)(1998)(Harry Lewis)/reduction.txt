reduction
polynomial reduction


reduction from language to language
-- language encodes problem
-- sentence encodes a instance of problem
reduction from problem to problem



function f : Seq sym -> Seq sym -- Seq means finite sequence; [a] may be infinite
algorithm for problem
decide : Seq sym -> Bool
reduction : Seq sym -> Seq sym'
    s.t. decideA = decideB . reductionA2B

reductionA2B = reductionA2C . reductionC2B
