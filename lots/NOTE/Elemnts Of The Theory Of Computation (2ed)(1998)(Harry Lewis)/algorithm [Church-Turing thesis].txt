[page 246] Chapter 5: UNDECIDABILITY
    We therefore propose to adopt the Turing machine that halts on all inputs as the precise formal notion corresponding to the intuitive notion of an "algorithm". Nothing will be considered an algorithm if it cannot be rendered as a Turing machine that is guaranteed to halt on all inputs, and all such machines will be rightfully called algorithms. This principle is known as the Church-Turing thesis. It is a thesis, not a theorem, because it is not a mathematical result: It simply asserts that a certain informal concept (algorithm) corresponds to a certain mathematical object (Turing machine). Not being a mathematical statement, the Church-Turing thesis cannot be proved. It is theoretically possible, however, that the Church-Turing thesis could be disproved at some future date, if someone were to propose an alternative model of computation that was publicly acceptable as a plausible and reasonable model of computation, and yet was provably capable of carrying out computations that cannot be carried out by any Turing machine. No one considers this likely.
