Physical Address == MAC Address
see:
    ipconfig /all

MAC_Address format:
    Ensure that the MAC address is formatted properly. Some adapters (especially Wi-Fi cards) are unforgiving of MAC addresses changes if the first octet's 2nd half isn't a 2,6,A,E or begins with a zero. This requirement has been observed as far back as Windows XP and is formatted as:
        D2XXXXXXXXXX
        D6XXXXXXXXXX
        DAXXXXXXXXXX
        DEXXXXXXXXXX


* Device Manager -> Network Adapters -> Properties -> Advanced tab -> "Network Address" or "Locally Administered Address" entry
    1. "Value" field
        new MAC address
            MAC addresses are 12-digit values
            be entered without any dashes or colons
            MAC address "2A:1B:4C:3D:6E:5F" ==>> enter "2A1B4C3D6E5F"
    2. disable and re-enable your adapter


*
    1. find out active network device
        ipconfig /all
        ==>> (MAC_Address, Description)
    2. net config rdr
        (MAC_Address, Description) ==>> {GUID}
    3. regedit.exe -> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{GUID}\DDD
        Description ==>> DDD
        new ....\DDD\NetworkAddress :: String = 2A1B4C3D6E5F
