Your "ipconfig" may often show a different IP address than that seen on sites such as "whatismyip". If this is the case for you, there are two possible explanations.

    The first explanation is that you did not initially check the right interface. You may have multiple IP addresses corresponding to multiple modems or WiFi connections. Use "ipconfig /all" to view all interfaces.

    The second explanation is that you are behind a router, gateway, or proxy. A router will perform address translation between the internet and your LAN (NAT). If this is the case, please refer to our tips on detecting your public IP and retrieving your public IP.

    Note that whatismyip sees only the internet address of your router, while "ipconfig" only sees the address of your computer.
