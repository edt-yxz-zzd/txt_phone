It seems that the WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is not running on your system or you don't have permissions.

You can download the WMI Diagnosis utility at

    # WMIDiag.exe

If this utility helps, perfect, you do not need to do anything now. If not, you need to repair the OS so that the desired application gets installed properly.
