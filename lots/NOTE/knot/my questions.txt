given a link diagram, though we can count the number of components,
    can we identify split sublinks??

my conjecture
    
    def [solvable link diagram] ::== the link is nonsplit, exist a set of arcs, s.t. 
        we can color the link by at least two color such that the color change once and only once on these arcs.
        we cut the above arcs and connect same color strands as if other color strands become simple strands without crossing.
        if the result link is split link and with few crossing number, we say the original link diagram is solvable.

    conjecture: is a non-solvable diagram contains minimal number of crossings??
