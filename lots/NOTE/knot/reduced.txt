reduced
    A diagram that has no nugatory crossings is called reduced.

nugatory
    A crossing in a link diagram is nugatory if there is a circle in the projection plane that meets the diagram transversely only at that crossing.
    // the crossing is a cut vertex.

    A nugatory crossings can clearly be removed by a flype (or perhaps by a single Type I Reidemeister move).


flype
    always a combination of Reidemeister moves
    \ /--=====---          ---======--\ /
     /   | T |       ==>>     | _L |   /
    / \--=====---          ---======--/ \

two alternating diagrams represent ambient isotopic links if and only if they are related by flypes
