equivalent
    A knot is a smooth, unoriented, embedding of S1 in S3, 
    where two such embeddings are considered equivalent 
        if there is a homeomorphism h : S3¡úS3 
            which takes one embedded circle to the other.

    [mirror diagram] ::= reverse all crossings and keep the orientation.
    [achiral] ::= ambient isotopic to mirror image
    [chiral] ::= not [achiral]
    In practice it is necessary to distinguish between chirality with or without orientation.
        For example the knot 8_17 is known to be ambient isotopic to its mirror image with reversed orientation, but it is chiral in the oriented case.

[page 8] isotopy ==>> equivalent ==X==>> isotopy
    if knots K1 and K2 belong to the same isotopy type, they are equivalent. The converse, however, is false. 
    Every homeomorphism h of R3 onto itself is 
        either orientation preserving
        or orientation reversing
    isotopy <==> orientation preserving

A knot K is amphicheiral (or achiral) iff 
    there exists an orientation preserving homeomorphism 
    of R3 onto itself which maps K onto its mirror image.
    
    where mirror image from (x,y,z)->(x,y,-z)
    
    clover-leaf knot and its mirror image are equivalent 
        but not of the same isotopy type.

invertible:
    iff exists orientation "preserving" homeomorphism h of R3 onto itself 
        "restriction" h|K is an orientation "reversing" homeomorphism of K onto itself
