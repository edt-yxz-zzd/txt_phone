but a knot may not be invertible!!
so connected sum products two result??? YES!!!
    from wiki knot_theory:
        ... Depending on how this is done, two different knots (but no more) may result...
        This ambiguity in the sum can be eliminated regarding the knots as oriented, i.e. having a preferred direction of travel along the knot, and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle.
        The knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative.
        
        [decomposition]
            A knot is prime if it is non-trivial and cannot be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots. A knot that can be written as such a sum is composite. There is a prime decomposition for knots, analogous to prime and composite numbers (Schubert 1949). For oriented knots, this decomposition is also unique.
    NOTE: "oriented"
