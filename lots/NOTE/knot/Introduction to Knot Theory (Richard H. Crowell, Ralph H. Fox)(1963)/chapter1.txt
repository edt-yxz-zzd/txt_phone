[knot]
    K is a knot
        <==> exists a homeomorphism of the unit circle C into 3-dimensional space R^3 whose image is K.
            i.e. exists an onto homeomorphism f : C->K where K <= R^3, C is a circle


[unknot] == [trivial knot] == [untied knot]
[overhand knot] == [clover-leaf knot] == [trefoil]
[figure-eight knot] == [four-knot] == [Listing's knot]



The property of being knotted is not an intrinsic topological property of the space consisting of the points of the knot, 
    but is rather a characteristic of the way in which that space is imbedded in R^3.

[knot type]
    knot K1, K2 are equivalent ::=
        exists a homomorphism of R^3 onto itself which maps K1 onto K2
        // really??
        // can we map a solid torus onto a circle??
        //    hence we can maps any knot onto untied knot
    knot type - a equivalence class of knots
    trivial type

[polygonal knot]
    the union of a finite number of closed straight-line segments called edges, whose endpoints are the vertices of the knot
[tame knot]
    knot K is tame ::= K is equivalent to a polygonal knot
[wild knot]
    non-tame knot

    The principal invariants of knot type, are not necessarily defined for a wild knot.
        // invariants: the elementary ideals, the knot polynomials ...


[knot projections]
    P : R^3 -> R^3
    P(x,y,z) = (x,y,0)
    
    order[K](u) = order of point u ::= cardinality({v in K | P(v) = u})
    
[regular position]
    a polygonal knot K is in regular position ::=
        order(u) <= 2 for u in K
        order(u) = 1 for u in vertices of K
    
    overcrossing v ::= 
        polygonal knot K in regular position
        order[K](P(v)) == 2 // ==>> v in K
        let {u, v} = P^-1 (P(v))
        v.z > u.z
    undercrossing

    Any polygonal knot K is equivalent under an arbitrarily small rotation of R^3 to a polygonal knot in regular position.
    ==>> every tame knot is equivalent to a polygonal knot in regular position





// below is not needed for the follow contents
    [isotopy type of knot]
        // model the motion
        // isotopy == ambient isotopy
        an onto homomorphism R^3 -> R^3
            orientation preserving : right-hand screw -> right-hand screw
            orientation reversing  : right-hand screw -> left-hand screw
        of same isotopy type ::= 
            exist an orientation preserving homeomorphism of R^3 on itself which maps one knot onto the other.

    [amphicheiral knot]
        knot K is amphicheiral ::=
            exists an orientation reversing homeomorphism h[-1] of R^3 onto itself s.t. 
                h[-1](K)=K
        <==> exists an orientation preserving homeomorphism h[+1] of R^3 onto its mirror image s.t. 
                h[+1](K)=mirror(K) // mirror is a h[-1]
        <==> K and its mirror image are of the same isotopy type
        
        
        clover-leaf knot is not amphicheiral
            clover-leaf knot and its mirror image are equivalent but not of the same isotopy type.
            // ?? any knot and its mirror image are equivalent?? yes!
        
        // at most two knots have homeomorphic complements (the original knot and its mirror reflection).
        // amphicheiral knot <--> its complement
        // {non-amphicheiral knot and its mirror} <--> its complement

    [invertible knot]
        Just as every homeomorphism of R^3 onto itself either preserves or reverses orientation, 
            so does every homeomorphism of a knot onto itself.
        knot K is invertible ::=
            exists an an orientation preserving homeomorphism h of R^3 onto itself s.t.
                h[K] is an orientation reversing homeomorphism of K onto itself
            // R^3 - preserving
            // K - reversing
    [noninvertible knots]
