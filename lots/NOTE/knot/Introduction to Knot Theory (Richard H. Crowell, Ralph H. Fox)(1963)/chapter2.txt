    topologic space X
    path p : [a,b] -> X
        let a ::= 0
        let |p| ::= b-a // stop time
        p(0) - initial point
        p(|p|) - terminal point
    
    [product] p <+> q
        requires: p(|p|) is q(0)
        (p <+> q)(t) = p(t) if t in [0,|p|] else q(t-|p|)
        |p <+> q| = |p| + |q|
    
    [identity path]
        |e| = 0
        e <+> p = p
        p <+> e = p
    [constant path]
        p(t) = c for t in [0,|p|]
    [inverse path]
        |p^-1| = |p|
        p^-1(t) = p(|p|-t) for t in [0, |p|]
        p <+> p^-1 is an identity path <==> p is an identity path
        p <+> p^-1 is a constant path <==> p is a constant path
        p <+> p^-1 is a loop
    
    [loop]
        p(0) = p(|p|)
    [v-based loop]
    v = p(0) = p(|p|)
    the set of all p-based loops in X is a semi-group with identity.
        A set H having one associative binary operation * is called a semigroup.
        semigroup - e.g. (N+, +)
        semigroup with identity - e.g. (N, +)





[continuous family of paths]
    {p[s] | for s in [0,1]}
        stopping time |p[s]| depends continuously on s
        p(s, t) = p[s](t) :: (s,t) -> X; for s in [0,1] for t in [0,|p[s]|]. 
            continuously into
            continuous in both simultaneously
    
    [fixed-endpoint family of paths]
        p[s](0) and p[s](|p[s]|) are independent of s
        // 该书使用 等时线 Figure 10

    [equivalent]
        p[0] ~=~ p[1]
            p[0] is equivalent to p[1] if {p[s]} is a fixed-endpoint family
        fixed-endpoint
        continuity of stopping time
        simultaneous continuity in s and t.

    [equivalence class]
        [p]
        [p] = [q] <==> p ~=~ q <==> p can be continuously deformed onto q in X without moving the endpoints.

    [fundamental groupoid of topological space]
        GAMMA(X) ::= {[p] | for path p in topological space X}
        see APPENDIX II : 
            groupoid = category + inversable
            {x | x * e and e * x are defined where e is an identity and x in groupoid} is a group
            (e1 * x, x * e2 ==>> select those x s.t. e1 = e2; e.g. loop instead of path)
    [fundamental group]
        pi(X, v) ::= v-based loop equivalence classes; is a group (see above APPENDIX II)
            fundamental group of X relative to the basepoint v 
    
    [pathwise connected]
        A topological space X is pathwise connected if any two of its points can be joined by a path lying in X.
        pi(X, v) ~=~ pi(X, v') if exists p s.t. p(0) = v, p(|p|) = v'.
            q -> p^-1 <+> q <+> p for q in pi(X, v)
        the fundamental group of a pathwise connected space is independent of the basepoint in the sense that the groups defined for any two basepoints are isomorphic.
            fundamental group pi(X) instead of pi(X, v)

    [homomorphism induced by a continuous mapping]
        p : [0, |p|] -> X
        f : X -> Y
        f* : GAMMA(X) -> GAMMA(Y)
            f*([p]) = [f.p]
            f*([p(t)]) = [f(p(t))]
        f* : pi(X, v) -> pi(Y, f(v)) 
            // restricting f* to pi(X, v) instead of GAMMA(X)
            homomorphism induced by f

        the homomorphism of the fundamental group induced by a continuous mapping provides the bridge from topology to algebra in knot theory.

        (4.7) THEOREM. 
            If f: X->Y is a homeomorphism of X onto Y, the induced homomorphism f*: pi(X,v)->pi(Y,f(v)) is an isomorphism onto for any basepoint v in X.
                It is by this method that many knots can be distinguished from one another.
                knots K, K'; if pi(R^3-K) ~=!=~ pi(R^3-K') ==>> K and K' are different.
                ?? but we can tell nothing if they are the same??

[calculation of fundamental group]
    the fundamental group of any convex set ==>> {e} the trivial group
        convex set ==>> simply-connected ==>> pathwise connected
        the fundamental group is trivial <==> simply-connected

    the fundamental group of the circle is infinite cyclic.
