[retraction]
    [retraction of topological space]
        a continuous mapping f: X -> Y 
            where Y is a subspace of X; 
                  f(y)=y for y in Y; i.e. Y <= Fix(f)
        ==>> f is onto
        [retract]
            Y is a retract of X <==> exists retraction f:X->Y
            A point is a retract of any space that contains it.

            [interior of close set] $$ o \atop D $$
                interior(D) = D - boundary(D)
            [boundary of close set??] boundary(D) = $$ . \atop D $$
                point v in disc D ==>> boundary(D) is a retract of D-v
                circle C is the core of the solid torus V ==>> 
                    C is a retract of V
                    boundary(V) (a torus) is a retract of V-C


        [HOWTO] how to prove the nonexistence of a retraction?
            (1.1) If f: X->Y is a retraction and X is pathwise connected, 
                  then, for any basepoint v in X, the induced homornorphism f^*: pi(X,v)->pi(Y,f(v)) is onto.
            // pi(X, v) - the fundamental group of the containing space X relative to the basepoint v


[deformation]
    X is deformable into/onto Y <==> Y is a subspace of X; X can be continuously shrunk into/onto Y
    into - image of deformation <= Y
    onto - image of deformation == Y
    
    continuously shrunk??
    
    [deformation of topological space]
        deformation of topological space X ::= {h[s] | h[s]:X->X, s in [0,1]} 
            where h[0] = 1[X]
                  let h2(s, x) = h[s](x)
                  h2 is simultaneously continuousin the two variables
    [deformation of space into (or onto) subspace]
        deformation of a space X into (or onto) a subspace Y ::=
            {h[s] | h[s]:X->X, s in [0,1]}
            where Y <= X
                  h[0] = 1[X]
                  h[1](X) <= (or ==) Y
                  let h2(s, x) = h[s](x)
                  h2 is simultaneously continuous in the two variables
                  
    deformable <==> exists a deformation
    
    // ERROR: onto deformation is a retraction?? 
    disc can be deformed onto its boundary
        by: disc -> diameter (line segment) --[connect two ends]-->> circle
        // NOTE: Image(retraction) <= Fix(retraction)
        but boundary(disc) is not a retract of the disc

    [realizable by a deformation of space]
        f is realizable by a deformation of space X <==>
            continuous mapping f: X->Y // into
            Y <= space X
            exists a deformation {h[s]}, s.t. h[1] = i . f
                where i: Y->X is the inclusion mapping; i.e. i(y)=y
        ==>> for v in X, f^* : pi(X, v) -> pi(Y, f(v)) is a isomorphism into
        ==>> boundary(square) -> edge(square) is a retract but not realizable
    // retract : more holes to less holes
    // deform : less holes to more holes

[deformation retract of space]
    Y is a deformation retract of space X <==>
        exists a retraction f : X->Y
            s.t. f is realizable by a deformation of X
    // ==>> num of holes holds
    (1.4) If a subspace Y is a deformation retract of a pathwise connected topological space X, 
          then pi(X) is isomorphic to pi(Y).
          // retract : pi->pi is "onto"
          // realizable : pi->pi is "isomorphism into"
          // ==>> "isomorphism onto"

    
    (1.5) Y is a deformation retract of X <==>
          exists retraction f : X->Y + X can be deformed into Y 
            ==>> f can be realized by a deformation

[knot K][solid pipe P][K is core of P]
    ==>> pi(R^3 - K) ~=~ pi(R^3 - interior(P))
    // but may not pi(R^3 - P)?? what "horned"??
    

[homotopy type]
    Topological spaces X and Y are of the same homotopy type <==> 
        there exists a finite sequence X = X[0], ..., X[n] = Y
        s.t. X[i-1] ~=~ X[i] // is topologically equivalent to
            or X[i] is a deformation retract of X[i-1]
            or X[i-1] is a deformation retract of X[i]

    (2.1) If X and Y are pathwise connected spaces of the same homotopy type,
          then pi(X)is ~=~ pi(Y).

    Homotopy type is one of the most important equivalence relations in algebraic topology; 
        most of the algebraic invariants are invariants of homotopy type. 
        It is a much weaker relation than that of topological equivalence.
