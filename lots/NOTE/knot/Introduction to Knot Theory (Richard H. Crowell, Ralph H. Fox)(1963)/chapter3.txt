[free group]
    F[A]
    alphabet - A = set of letters
    letter - a
    syllable - a^n where [letter a][integer n]
    word - a finite ordered sequence of syllable
        a syllable is a one syllable word
        empty word is the zero syllable word
    
    W(A) - set of all words formed from A
        semigroup if product ::= concat
    in order to form a group, we collect the words together into equivalence classes
    
    [type I]
        w1 . a^0 . w2 <--> w1 . w2
        --> : elementary contraction of type I
        <-- : elementary expansion of type I
    [type II]
        w1 . a^m . a^n . w2 <--> w1 . a^(m+n) . w2
        --> : elementary contraction of type II
        <-- : elementary expansion of type II

    [equivalent]
        word + sequence of elementary contraction/expansion
    
    F[A] = the set of equivalence classes of words.
        the free group on the alphabet A
        empty alphabet ==>> trivial group
    
    [reduced word]
        word such that not possible to apply any elementary contraction to it
    

[the subgroup generated by subset]
    the subgroup generated by empty set is trivial
    [generating set]
    the set is called a generating set of elements of the group generated by it
    assume A = {a,b,c,...}
    [A] ::= {[a], [b], [c], ...} # [a] - the word class containing word "a"
    [A] is a generating set of elements of F[A]
    
[free basis]
    set E is a free basis of group G <==> 
        1) E is a generating set of elements of a group G
        2) for any group H for any f: E->H, ==>> exists homomorphism g: G->H where g|E = f
        
        [free]
            G is a free group
            <==> G is a group that has a free basis
            <==> G ~=~ F[A] for some A
            


[page 36](3.2) Any group is a homomorphic image of some free group.
    This fact is of the utmost importance for the theory of group presentations;
    it means that, using free groups as "coordinate systems," any group can be coordinatized.
