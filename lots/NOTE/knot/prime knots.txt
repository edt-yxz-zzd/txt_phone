A knot is prime if it is non-trivial and cannot be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots.

crossing number - mirror image
    Traditionally, knots have been catalogued in terms of crossing number. Knot tables generally include only prime knots, and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image (even if they are different) 

number_of_prime_knots[crossing_number] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 21, 49, 165, 552, 2176, 9988, 46972, 253293, 1388705, ...] # [0..16]

prime knots are classified by their fundamental groups.
    prime knots with isomorphic fundamental groups have homeomorphic complements [by W. Whitten]
    knots with homeomorphic complements are equivalent [by C. McA. Gordon and J. Leucke]
