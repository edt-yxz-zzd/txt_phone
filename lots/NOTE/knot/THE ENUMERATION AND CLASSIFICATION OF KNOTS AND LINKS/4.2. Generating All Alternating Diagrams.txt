    A link is alternating if it is represented by a diagram whose crossings alternate, over-under-over-under and so on, as one travels around the components.
    nonalternating knots exist

4.2. Generating All Alternating Diagrams. 
    generating the n-crossing alternating diagrams from the k-crossing diagrams, where k < n.
    
    [D is a reduced, prime, alternating link diagram of n crossings]
    [smoothing] = [nullifying] ==>> D'
        the number of components may be changed. {0, 1}

    [pure crossing] ::= between two strands of the same component
    [mixed crossing] ::= between two strands of different components
    
    there is always at least one crossing in D that can be smoothed so that 
        the resulting diagram D' will reduce, after eliminating nugatory crossings, 
            to a reduced, prime, alternating link diagram.

    // but if D1->D1', D2->D2', 
    //      D1' ~!~ D2' ==??==>> D1 ~!~ D2
    //      D1' ~=~ D2' ==??==>> D1 ~=~ D2
