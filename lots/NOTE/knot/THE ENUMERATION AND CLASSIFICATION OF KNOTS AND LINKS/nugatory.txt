[nugatory] [page 6]
    A crossing in a link diagram is nugatory if there is a circle in the projection plane that meets the diagram transversely only at that crossing. 
    A nugatory crossings can clearly be removed by a flype (or perhaps by a single Type I Reidemeister move). 

[reduced] 
    A diagram that has no nugatory crossings is called reduced.
    
    is [4, 6, -2] reduced?
    
    // it seems we concern reduced alternating diagrams

        [reduced nonalternating projections]
            the "Perko pair", two ten crossing knots of writhe 10 and 8 respectively, that are ambient isotopic.
