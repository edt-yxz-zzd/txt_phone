[multiedges!!]
    since edge signed, edges should be ordered
    but we can remove +- pairs ==>> multiedges with same signed ==>> need not order

    The signed planar graph associated with a knot diagram.

Another convenient representation of knot diagrams was introduced by Peter Tait in 1877.

1) color knot diagram into black/white faces
    [outer face be black]
    Any knot diagram defines a plane graph whose vertices are the crossings and whose edges are paths in between successive crossings. Exactly one face of this planar graph is unbounded; each of the others is homeomorphic to a 2-dimensional disks. Color these faces black or white so that the unbounded face is black and any two faces that share a boundary edge have opposite colors. The Jordan curve theorem implies that there is exactly one such coloring.

2) white faces as vertices, crossings as edges with signs
    [rotate under-strand to the new edges avoid the over-strand in clockwise be a left guide signed +]
    We construct a new plane graph whose vertices are the white faces and whose edges correspond to crossings. We can label each edge in this graph as a left edge or a right edge, depending on which thread appears to go over the other as we view the corresponding crossing from one of the endpoints of the edge. Left and right edges are typically indicated by labeling left edges + and right edges ¨C, or by drawing left edges with solid lines and right edges with dashed lines.
    The original knot diagram is the medial graph of this new plane graph, with the type of each crossing determined by the sign of the corresponding edge. Changing the sign of every edge corresponds to reflecting the knot in a mirror.
