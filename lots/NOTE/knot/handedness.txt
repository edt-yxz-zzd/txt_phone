handedness # property of crossing
right handed crossing
    for arbitrary orientation,
    rotate under-strand to over-strand in clockwise
    over-strand as x-axis, under-strand as y-axis, z-axis points to reader



Dowker notation
    4 -5 6 # for both left/right handed trefoil knot
    there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing a knot from a Dowker notation.
Extended Gauss Code
    to handle handedness

    but I think it is too long. I think we can use a modified Dowker notation which carry the handedness per integer. but was it unambiguous????
