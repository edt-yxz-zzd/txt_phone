[THE ENUMERATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF KNOTS AND LINKS]
    [page 7]
    But since no a priori bound on the number of such moves which might be required to pass between two given diagrams exists, we cannot algorithmically decide, by exploring a finite number of Reidemeister moves, if two diagrams are in fact equivalent.
    // we cannot algorithmically decide !!!!

    prime knots are classified by their fundamental groups
    
    [recognition problem]
        is there an algorithm that can decide, in a finite amount of time, if any given pair of links are equivalent?
    
    [page 8]
    In theory, the link recognition problem has been solved.
    // so we can... huh??

        // 2^(n*2^11)
    
    [page 10]
    Since the Haken link recognition algorithm is impractical, 
    [practical] what can we actually do when confronted with two link diagrams wanting to know if they are the same link?
        [diff?]
            we begin by computing as many invariants as we can, beginning with the easiest to compute and moving to the more difficult. 
        [same?]
            If all known invariants fail to tell the links apart, then perhaps they are the same, 
                and we can launch ourselves into an attempt to relate the two diagrams by Reidemeister moves (or combinations of Reidemeister moves, such as flypes and other moves to be described later). 
        Of course the entire process is ad hoc, and may not lead to a definite answer. 
            The harsh reality of knot theory is that we will probably never be able to decide if two arbitrary links are the same or not. Just imagine being given two link diagrams with a few million crossings each!
    
    for certain classes of knots and links, spectacular classification results have been obtained.
        torus links, 2-bridge links, 3-string braids, alternating links and hyperbolic links.
        The last two classes have proven especially useful to the link tabulator wanting to classify all (prime) links up to a given crossing number.
    
    [reduced alternating link diagram] 
        
        Tait made three conjectures about alternating knots, all of which can be stated for links. 
            The first was that reduced, alternating diagrams have minimal crossing number; 
            the second, that any two reduced alternating diagrams of the same link (here same means ambient isotopic) have the same writhe
                (the writhe of a diagram is the number of right handed crossings minus the number of left handed crossings); 
            the third, that two alternating diagrams represent ambient isotopic links if and only if they are related by flypes.
            // all proved
            // [page 14]
            a reduced alternating diagram represents a prime link if and only if it is prime as a diagram. 
                That is, if no circle in the projection plane meets the diagram transversely in two points with crossings on either side, then in fact the link is prime. 
                This result is an incredible boon to the tabulator, allowing easy recognition of composite alternating links.
        
        [page 11]
        Given two reduced alternating link diagrams, we can algorithmically generate the entire flype equivalence class of one and check to see if it contains the other.
            Unlike the Reidemeister moves, the equivalence classes of diagrams related by flypes are all finite.
    
        // 0 = lim num_alternating_links/num_link {crossing_number->+oo}
    [hyperbolic link]
        These are links for which the complement admits a complete Riemannian metric of constant curvature -1.
        The canonical triangulation (together with meridian data) provides a complete link invariant!
    
        Of the 1, 701, 936 prime knots with 16 or less crossings, all but 32 are hyperbolic.
        
        every knot is either a torus knot, a satellite knot, or a hyperbolic knot.


    [page 13]
    It is worth pointing out though that one of the more obvious ¡°theorems¡± of knot theory, that crossing number is additive under connected sum, has yet to be proven (or, incredibly, could it be false?)

    [page 14]
    [tabulate]
        1) prime alternating link diagrams ==[flype equivalence class]==>> prime alternating links
        2) each alternating link ==>> nonalternating diagrams
            then ad hoc methods must be employed to either distinguish all that remains (by computing various invariants), or recognize repeats (by finding sequences of Reidemeister moves or, in the case of hyperbolic links, comparing canonical triangulations)
            
            // ad hoc method...
            // what if we can neither distinguish nor recognize repeats ??
            
            
        
[Knot theory - Wikipedia]
    a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.
    A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists, which has unknown complexity.
    // unknown complexity?? can it halt?? 
    
    
    The original motivation for the founders of knot theory was to create a table of knots and links, which are knots of several components entangled with each other.
    
    
    
    [recognition problem]
        The basic problem of knot theory, the recognition problem, is determining the equivalence of two knots. Algorithms exist to solve this problem, with the first given by Wolfgang Haken in the late 1960s (Hass 1998). Nonetheless, these algorithms can be extremely time-consuming, and a major issue in the theory is to understand how hard this problem really is (Hass 1998). The special case of recognizing the unknot, called the unknotting problem, is of particular interest (Hoste 2005).
