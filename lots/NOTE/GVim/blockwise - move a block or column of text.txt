vim move a block or column of text
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/620360/how-to-move-a-block-or-column-of-text
    I have the following text as a simple case:
        ...
        abc xxx 123 456
        wer xxx 345 678676
        ...
    what I need to move a block of text xxx to another location:
        ...
        abc 123 xxx 456
        wer 345 xxx 678676
        ...
    I think I use visual mode to block a column of text, what are the other commands to move the block to another location?


========================================
You should use blockwise visual mode (Ctrl+v). Then d to delete block, p or P to paste block.
========================================
Marking text (visual mode)

    v - start visual mode, mark lines, then do command (such as y-yank)
    V - start Linewise visual mode
    o - move to other end of marked area
    Ctrl+v - start visual block mode
    O - move to Other corner of block
    aw - mark a word
    ab - a () block (with braces)
    aB - a {} block (with brackets)
    ib - inner () block
    iB - inner {} block
    Esc - exit visual mode

Visual commands

    > - shift right
    < - shift left
    y - yank (copy) marked text
    d - delete marked text
    ~ - switch case

Cut and Paste

    yy - yank (copy) a line
    2yy - yank 2 lines
    yw - yank word
    y$ - yank to end of line
    p - put (paste) the clipboard after cursor
    P - put (paste) before cursor
    dd - delete (cut) a line
    dw - delete (cut) the current word
    x - delete (cut) current character


========================================
One of the few useful command I learned at the beginning of learning VIM is :1,3 mo 5 This means move text line 1 through 3 to line 5.

And you can select the lines in visual mode, then press : to get :'<,'> (equivalent to the :1,3 part in your answer), and add mo N. If you want to move a single line, just :mo N. If you are really lazy, you can omit the space (e.g. :mo5). Use marks with mo '{a-zA-Z}. – Júda Ronén Jan 18 '17 at 21:20

just m also works – Miles Jun 29 '17 at 23:44



========================================
In VIM, press Ctrl+V to go in Visual Block mode
Select the required columns with your arrow keys and press x to cut them in the buffer.
Move cursor to row 1 column 9 and press P (thats capital P) in command mode.
Press Ctrl+Shift+b to get in and out of it.
