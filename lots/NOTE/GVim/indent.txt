indent : = >



30.2*	Indenting C style text
In Visual mode "=" indents the selected lines.  A useful text
object is "a{".  This selects the current {} block.  Thus, to re-indent the
code block the cursor is in: >

	=a{

If you have really badly indented code, you can re-indent the whole file with:
>
	gg=G
