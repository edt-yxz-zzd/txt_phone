problem:
    deterministic FSM ==>> mini nondeterministic re


unproven:
    clean deterministic FSM ==>> multiedge directed graph with self-loops (each edge associated with a element in {none} | alphabet)
    name the initial states as sources and the final states as sinks
    find a mini cut vertex set CUT. assume size == L.
    then we make L new FSMs:
        for q in CUT:
            yield fsm(re(FSM) - re(FSM.delete(q)))
    each newFSM ==>> exists a cut vertex V ==>> newFSM = leftFSM . rightFSM where leftFSM endby V and rightFSM startby V
