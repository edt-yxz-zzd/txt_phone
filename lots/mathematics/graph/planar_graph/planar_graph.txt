In graph theory, a planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints. In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other. Such a drawing is called a plane graph or planar embedding of the graph.


Plane graphs can be encoded by combinatorial maps.


Kuratowski's theorem:
A finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three, also known as the utility graph).



Wagner's theorem:
A finite graph is planar if and only if it does not have K5 or K3,3 as a minor.

In graph theory, an undirected graph H is called a minor of the graph G if H is isomorphic to a graph that can be obtained by zero or more edge contractions on a subgraph of G.An edge contraction is an operation which removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices it used to connect. An undirected graph H is a minor of another undirected graph G if a graph isomorphic to H can be obtained from G by contracting some edges, deleting some edges, and deleting some isolated vertices. The order in which a sequence of such contractions and deletions is performed on G does not affect the resulting graph H.



However, there exist fast algorithms for this problem: for a graph with n vertices, it is possible to determine in time O(n) (linear time) whether the graph may be planar or not (see planarity testing).


For a simple, connected, planar graph with v vertices and e edges, the following simple planarity criteria hold:
Theorem 1. If v ¡Ý 3 then e ¡Ü 3v - 6;
Theorem 2. If v ¡Ý 3 and there are no cycles of length 3, then e ¡Ü 2v - 4.
can only be used to prove a graph is not planar, not that it is planar. 

A simple graph is called maximal planar if it is planar but adding any edge (on the given vertex set) would destroy that property. All faces (even the outer one) are then bounded by three edges, explaining the alternative term plane triangulation.
If a maximal planar graph has v vertices with v > 2, then it has precisely 3v - 6 edges and 2v - 4 faces.



For two planar graphs with v vertices, it is possible to determine in time O(v) whether they are isomorphic or not (see also graph isomorphism problem).
















PQ tree vertex addition method

The vertex addition method began with an inefficient O(n2) method conceived by Lempel, Even and Cederbaum in 1967.[2] It was improved by Even and Tarjan, who found a linear-time solution for the s,t-numbering step,[3] and by Booth and Lueker, who developed the PQ tree data structure. With these improvements it is linear-time and outperforms the path addition method in practice.[4] This method was also extended to allow a planar embedding (drawing) to be efficiently computed for a planar graph.[5]
[edit]PC tree vertex addition method

In 1999, Shih and Hsu developed a planarity testing algorithm that was significantly simpler than classical methods based on a new type of data structure called the PC tree and a postorder traversal of the depth-first search tree of the vertices.[6]
[edit]Edge addition method

In 2004, Boyer and Myrvold [7] developed a simplified O(n) algorithm, originally inspired by the PQ tree method, which gets rid of the PQ tree and uses edge additions to compute a planar embedding, if possible. Otherwise, a Kuratowski subdivision (of either K5 or K3,3) is computed. This is one of the two current state-of-the-art algorithms today (the other one is the planarity testing algorithm of de Fraysseix, de Mendez and Rosenstiehl[8][9]). See [10] for an experimental comparison with a preliminary version of the Boyer and Myrvold planarity test. Furthermore, the Boyer¨CMyrvold test was extended to extract multiple Kuratowski subdivisions of a non-planar input graph in a running time linearly dependent on the output size.[11] The source code for the planarity test[12][13] and the extraction of multiple Kuratowski subdivisions[12] is publicly available. Algorithms that locate a Kuratowski subgraph in linear time in vertices were developed by Williamson in the 1980s.[14]
